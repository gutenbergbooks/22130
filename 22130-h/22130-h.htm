<p>The February wind blows keenly, as we lean from the window of our railway
carriage, and watch dismantled house-boats, drawn up on the river bank just
outside Windsor, being prepared for the forthcoming season. Some Eton boys&mdash;it
is evidently a holiday&mdash;stand looking on with lively interest. Several people
get out of the train, walk into the quaint old-fashioned street, and
disappear. We follow them, charter a hansom, and are driven along a
picturesque road in the direction of the late Prince Consort&#8217;s Shaw Farm. This
road is almost deserted, save for half-a-dozen cavalrymen who come riding down
it, their brilliant red uniforms lighting up the dull air through which the
sunlight vainly endeavours to struggle. Their horses are bespattered with mud;
there is mud everywhere&mdash;a thick, glutinous mud; but when we enter the
precincts of the Shaw Farm everything gives place to an ordered and dainty
neatness which is thoroughly characteristic of the Royal domains.</p>

<p>We are received by Mr. W. Tait, the Queen&#8217;s Land Steward at Windsor, whose
handsome stalwart figure is so well known to all leading agriculturists, and
conducted to a natty little office decorated with water-colour drawings of
prize cattle, and various other reminiscences of past triumphs. Mr. Tait&#8217;s
drawing-room, in common with those of his <em>confr&egrave;res</em> at Windsor, is
embellished by various signed portraits of Her Majesty and the Royal family.</p>

<p>From here, we cross the road and enter a stable where two beautiful old grey
carriage horses are being prepared by one of the <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 244]</span>farm hands for our
inspection, to a continuous accompaniment of sibilant ostler language. They
have evidently been running wild in the park for some time; each white coat is
stained with mud, and burrs stick tenaciously to their long tails. An
attendant at the farm is rubbing them down, talking to them, and making them
generally presentable. He is evidently on good terms with his charges, for one
playfully nibbles his broad back, whilst the other tries to steal his red
pocket-handkerchief. &ldquo;Flora&rdquo; and &ldquo;Alma&rdquo; were presented to Her Majesty by the
late King Victor Emanuel of Italy. They are about fourteen hands high,
tremendously powerful, and beautifully shaped. One of them has also been used
to draw the Queen&#8217;s chair about the grounds; but they are both now regarded as
honoured pensioners, and do no work at all.</p>

<p>The kindliness and affection with which Her Majesty speaks of favourite
animals in her various writings may well assure us that in the midst of state
and family cares, manifold though they be, her old pets, even after death, are
not forgotten. Of this we have evidence later on.</p>

<p>The next shed to that of the old greys is occupied by a magnificent chestnut
charger over seventeen hands high, once the property of the late Emperor
Frederic of Germany. In appearance, this charger is as fresh and vigorous as a
horse of five. It was given by the Emperor to Prince Christian, who rode it
for four years. The charger has a sprightly, though somewhat incongruous,
companion in the shape of &ldquo;Ninette,&rdquo; a little white donkey which was purchased
at Grasse by Her Majesty, and presented to the Princess Victoria of Connaught,
for whose use it is now being broken in. Directly the donkey is taken out of
the stable for educational purposes, the charger becomes restless and unhappy,
races round the paddock attached to his loose box in evident distress, and
refuses to be comforted until his beautiful little companion returns. Then he
playfully nibbles her back, joyfully flings up his heels, and careers wildly
round the paddock, neighing shrilly as he goes, his long tail floating in the
breeze. What will happen when &ldquo;Ninette&rdquo; leaves her companion it is difficult
to say. At present she takes little notice of this exuberant display of
affection, beyond running beneath the charger&#8217;s belly, and playfully trying to
plant her tiny heels in his lofty side. When they have been twice round the
paddock, &ldquo;Ninette&rdquo; plodding gamely on, a long way in the rear, the couple halt
at the shed entrance, and look at us with exuberant curiosity, the donkey&#8217;s
long ears shooting backwards and forwards with great rapidity.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 245]</span>After inspecting this somewhat incongruous couple, we are taken to another
stable to see &ldquo;Jenny,&rdquo; a white donkey, twenty-five years old. &ldquo;Jenny&rdquo; belongs
to the Queen, and was bred at Virginia Water. Her Majesty saw &ldquo;Jenny&rdquo; when she
was a foal, had her brought to Windsor and trained, and there the docile old
animal has remained ever since. She is pure white in colour, with large,
light, expressive grey eyes. One peculiarity about her is an enormous flat
back, soft and almost as wide as a moderate-sized feather bed. A handsome
chestnut foal is temporarily quartered with her. This foal was bred from a
mare belonging to the late Mr. John Brown, and promises to grow into a very
beautiful animal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/img245.jpg" width="500" height="385" alt="&quot;jenny.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;jenny.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Jenny,&rdquo; although rather reserved, affably condescends to partake of a
biscuit, pensively twitching her long ears after us as we depart along the
road leading to the Royal dairy. As we leave the trimly built and picturesque
outbuildings there is a brave burst of sunshine; chaffinches &ldquo;chink-chink&rdquo; in
the trees around, producing a sharp, clear sound as if two pebbles were struck
against each other; rooks sail majestically overhead, their sentinels, posted
in the trees around, giving notice of our approach; and the pale petals of a
rathe primrose gleam shyly out from a sheltering hedge. <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 246]</span>The park is filled
with Scotch cattle with beautiful heads and matted, shaggy hides. In the next
paddock a handsome Jersey cow thrusts her head over the intervening rails and
licks the shaggy frontlet of a small dun bull, who gives a gentle low of
satisfaction, and endeavours to follow us as we pass through the gate in the
direction of the Queen&#8217;s dairy. At this section of the farm, in the buildings,
we find &ldquo;Tewfik,&rdquo; a very fine white Egyptian donkey, with large black eyes and
tremendous ears.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/img246.jpg" width="500" height="436" alt="&quot;tewfik.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;tewfik.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>He is one of those enormous asses which are so greatly esteemed in the
East for their powers of endurance. It is a curious fact that a donkey
of this kind will do as much work as a horse, last twice the time on a
long march, and never break down. &ldquo;Tewfik&rdquo; was purchased by Lord
Wolseley in Cairo, and sent to England, gay with magnificent Oriental
trappings, and clipped all over in most extraordinary patterns,
resembling Greek architectural ornaments. These patterns are a source of
great trouble to the unsophisticated traveller in the East. He learns
one side of his donkey by heart, and never thinks of looking at the
other; <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 247]</span>consequently, when he sees the hitherto unknown side of the
animal, he is inclined to think that some wight has been playing a
practical joke, and substituted a different beast for the one he has
bestridden. &ldquo;Tewfik&rdquo; was much admired at the Jubilee Agricultural Show
in Windsor Great Park, and seems really a very amiable, well-mannered,
aristocratic animal. He is delighted to see us, and prefers sweet
biscuits to plain. Indeed, it is with regret that he watches us depart.
His long mobile ears shoot out from the stable door as he endeavours to
follow us into the box of his neighbour, a dainty Shetland pony, some
three feet six inches high, which is usually known as &ldquo;The Skewbald.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/img247.jpg" width="500" height="398" alt="&quot;the skewbald.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;the skewbald.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>This diminutive little lady welcomes us in the most charming manner, and
is as frolicsome as a kitten, romping about and playing all sorts of
tricks. Her mission in life, besides being everyone&#8217;s pet, is to draw a
small two-wheeled cart for Her Majesty&#8217;s grandchildren. The dainty,
trim, little brown-and-white beauty possesses enormous strength, and
takes existence very philosophically. The first time she was put into
harness she acted as if <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 248]</span>she had been accustomed to it all her life, and
never required the slightest breaking in. There is another Shetland pony
in one of the neighbouring paddocks, but she is dark brown in colour,
and, with her long-flowing mane and tail, looks like a miniature
carthorse. Like most of Her Majesty&#8217;s animals, she is fond of society,
and objects to be separated from a large handsome grey donkey which was
bought on one of the Continental journeys, and now occupies the same
paddock as the Shetland. In order to take the pony&#8217;s portrait
comfortably, it was found necessary to invite the donkey to be present
as a spectator.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/img248.jpg" width="500" height="446" alt="&quot;the shetland mare.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;the shetland mare.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>The next pet to be inspected is an animal which most people would prefer to
cultivate at a distance, being none other than the enormous bison named
&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; a magnificent specimen of his race, who was obtained in exchange from
the Zoological Society. The Canadian grew savage, and had to be sent away.
&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; in spite of his immense strength, is of a very peaceful, almost
timorous, disposition. Strictly speaking, he can hardly be called a pet, as
the artist prudently takes his likeness from behind a high wall. All friendly
overtures to this last of his race are vain. He remains pensively gazing at
the opposite wall, a tear trickling down his broad nose. <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 249]</span>Even the joyful
bellow of his next-door neighbour, a half-grown Jersey bull, fails to attract
his attention, although the animal, as it recognises its keeper&#8217;s step, climbs
half over the wall to be fondled.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 339px;">
<img src="images/img249.jpg" width="339" height="500" alt="jack" title="" />
</div>

<p>Here we must not pass without examination some most beautiful little Jersey
calves with silky coats and great wondering eyes, which look as if the world
was a charming mystery to them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 250]</span>In the next stall to the Jersey bull stands an eccentric-looking little animal
called &ldquo;Sanger,&rdquo; a pony presented to Her Majesty by the well-known circus
proprietor of that name. &ldquo;Sanger&rdquo; is now nine months old. This strange little
animal&#8217;s breed is practically unknown, and his appearance most eccentric;
indeed, his legs show a tendency to stride to all points of the compass. In
colour he is cream; his eyes are grey, with pink lids; and he has white
eyelashes like an albino. His manners are not demonstrative, but coldly
courteous.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 366px;">
<img src="images/img250.jpg" width="366" height="400" alt="&quot;sanger.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;sanger.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Outside, in the park, is another pet, which was presented to Her Majesty by
Lord Wolseley, a peculiarly tall, deerlike-looking animal, a Zulu cow, bred
from a bull which was originally the property of Dabulamanzi, Cetewayo&#8217;s
brother. Cetewayo, curiously enough, when paying a visit to the Shaw Farm, saw
his brother&#8217;s cattle, but did not appear to admire them much when compared
with the English. A well-bred English cow has four times the substance and
breeding of her Zulu sister.</p>

<p>Attention may also be called to some magnificent red Spanish cattle, whose
noble heads and gigantic horns are in themselves a study for the artist.</p>

<p>It should be mentioned here that when Her Majesty drives through the private
road which leads from the Castle past the kennels and dairy to the Shaw Farm,
she likes to see the animals as they come up to the railings, and is thus able
to observe how former favourites bear the burden of their years. The Queen
names most of them herself, and never forgets an old friend.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 251]</span>Before going on to the kennels, by permission of the courteous manageress, we
enter the beautiful Royal dairy, which was built under the direction of His
Royal Highness the late Prince Consort in the twenty-first year of Her
Majesty&#8217;s reign. It is more like an apartment in fairyland than a dairy. The
walls and ceiling are composed of exquisitely shaded Minton tiles, the dairy
itself being about forty-five feet long and thirty wide. Long marble tables
run right round the sides and up the centre. On these tables are some 90 white
earthenware pans, each of which contains about seven quarts of milk. The
butter is sent to Osborne every day, and averages about twenty pounds weight
in winter and forty in summer. A small supply for the Queen&#8217;s own breakfast
table is also made in a special churn every morning.</p>

<p>Around the walls of the dairy are medallions of the Royal family, with the
monogram V.R. between. At each end of the dairy stands a beautiful fountain;
there is also one at the side. All these fountains came from the Exhibition of
1851; the design is a stork supporting a lily leaf into which the water falls.
The roof is supported by three pairs of arched pillars, and the windows are
double, the inner set being stained with designs of Tudor roses, hawthorn,
primroses, white marguerites, the rose, shamrock, thistle, and Scotch
harebell. The outer windows are plain glass. Beyond the glass is another
window of wire gauze, so minute that in hot weather both windows can be thrown
open to admit the air, and yet all intrusive insects kept at a distance. The
Royal herd generally consists of about fifty cows when they are all in milk,
principally shorthorns and Jerseys, twenty-five of each. Last year there were
fifty-four cows in milk, but the number usually averages about fifty.</p>

<p>The recesses in the dairy walls are filled with lovely old Crown Derby and
Worcester, together with a few Oriental china plates and dishes. There is also
a dish bearing the inscription, &ldquo;Chamberlain, Worcester, Manufacturer to His
Royal Highness the Prince Regent.&rdquo; Close to the dairy, stands an apartment
devoted to churns and huge milk-cans. Each milk-can bears the following
inscription on the top:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/img251.jpg" width="300" height="121" alt="inscription, home park windsor" title="" />
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 252]</span>After exhausting the wonders of the Royal dairy, we pass out into the sunshine
once more, but, before leaving the shrubbery, notice two little monuments to
the memory of long-deceased favourites, the inscriptions on which are as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 460px;">
<img src="images/img252.jpg" width="460" height="500" alt="boy" title="" />
</div>

<div class="centerbox bbox">BOY,<br /><br />

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 253]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 429px;">
<img src="images/img253.jpg" width="429" height="500" alt="boz" title="" />
</div>

<div class="centerbox2 bbox"><div class="figcenter">BOZ,</div><br />
The favourite Scottish terrier of the Duchess of Kent, to whom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he had been given in 1857 by the Queen and Prince Consort.<br /><br />

On March 16, 1861, he was taken back, and from that time till<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he died, Oct. 26, 1864, remained the faithful dog of the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surely, two touching and blameless little records!</p>

<p>Leaving these pets to their well-earned rest, we walk along the trimly-kept
private road leading to the Royal kennels. Here, when Her Majesty drives
along, she can see the Spanish oxen and other pets as they come up to the
railings and peer curiously over, <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 254]</span>the long horns of the oxen especially
making a formidable show which is entirely belied by their peaceful
disposition.</p>

<p>At the Royal kennels we are received by Mr. Hugh Brown, the manager, and his
able assistant, Mr. Hill, and shown into the apartment which is sometimes
occupied by Her Majesty when visiting the kennels. It is a quaint,
medium-sized room, with old oak rafters and oak furniture, comfortable chairs
and foot-rests predominating. The curtains are a warm, deep red, the carpet to
match, and a couple of little oak tables occupy the centre of the room. But
the unique feature about this apartment is the number of dog portraits on the
walls.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/img254.png" width="400" height="335" alt="sleeping compartment" title="" />
</div>

<p>There are dogs of every race, shape and colour; dogs large and small;
dogs lying down or standing up; dogs in oils; dogs in watercolours; all of
them labelled with the animal&#8217;s name and the artist who painted it. One or two
special favourites have a lock of their hair let into the woodwork of the
frame.</p>

<p>Outside, the tiled walk called the &ldquo;Queen&#8217;s Verandah&rdquo; is covered over as a
protection against the weather. Her Majesty is accustomed to walk up and down
here, and inspect the various occupants. There are several dogs in every
compartment. Each front yard measures ten feet by twelve; the sleeping
compartment is ten feet by ten. The wall in front stands nearly three feet
high, and has a rail on the top. Each yard is paved with red and blue tiles.
In the sleeping compartments, which are warmed by hot-water pipes, are benches
raised about a foot from the ground. Facing the &ldquo;Collie Court,&rdquo; as it is
called, is a large paddock which contains the bath&mdash;a curious aperture in the
ground, with sloping sides, so that a dog can run down, swim through the
middle, and walk up again on the other side.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 255]</span> The sides of this bath are lined
with little round stones. There is also an umbrella-shaped structure of wood,
under which the dogs can lie and sun themselves after the bath. Near the road
is a curious looking seat called &ldquo;The Apron Piece,&rdquo; with a railing in front.
The Queen sometimes sits here and watches the gambols of the dogs when they
are let loose in the paddock.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/img255.png" width="400" height="385" alt="the apron piece" title="" />
</div>

<p>There does not appear to be any hard and fast rule as to the housing of the
dogs. It all depends how they agree with each other. For instance, in one
compartment will be found a collie, Spitz, and dachshund; in the next, three
Spitzes and a pug; then two Skye terriers, three pugs, one dachshund; then two
lovely white collies; then one solitary collie whose coat is out of order, and
who comes up with big, beseeching eyes, as if imploring us to put an end to
her solitude. The most attractive sight is, of course, the twelve or thirteen
beautiful collies in one big compartment. In all there are about fifty-five
dogs, fifty-four of whom are in robust health, the hospital containing one
whippet. A beautiful little black Pomeranian &ldquo;Zeela&rdquo; inhabits a huge cage in
solitary state, and barks herself all over it at once. In the paddock outside
her cage are four beautiful black and tan collie pups, all eager for a romp.</p>

<p>Every dog in the Queen&#8217;s kennels is exercised twice a day, morning and
afternoon. The little dogs generally go out first, and then give place to the
big ones. Feeding time for the whole establishment is four o&#8217;clock in the
afternoon, but during very cold weather each animal is given some dry biscuit
every morning. The food is prepared in a kitchen reserved expressly for this
purpose, and consists of soaked biscuits, vegetables, meat, bullock&#8217;s head,
pluck, and sometimes a little beef. Oatmeal is also added to this <em>olla
podrida</em>. <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 256]</span>The dogs are all in hard condition, and look the picture of health.
It is difficult to tear oneself away from the collies, especially the two
lovely white ones and the little buff-coated Pomeranians, with tightly curling
tails and small, sharp ears.</p>

<p>Her Majesty&#8217;s love for dogs is so well known that it would be superfluous to
dwell upon such a topic. Wherever the Queen goes, she is accompanied by &ldquo;Spot&rdquo;
(a fox-terrier), &ldquo;Roy&rdquo; (a black and tan collie), and a lovely little brown
Spitz called &ldquo;Marco.&rdquo; Her favourite dogs are collies, and she possesses a
magnificent specimen in &ldquo;Darnley,&rdquo; who is now being exhibited at the
Agricultural Hall dog show. &ldquo;Darnley&rdquo; is a beautiful black and tan in colour,
with heavy white ruff. He has a most curious habit, inherited from his father,
of wrinkling up the skin of his nose and showing all his teeth when pleased.
Another animal away at the show is the little eight-months old Skye terrier,
&ldquo;Rona.&rdquo; &ldquo;Rona&rdquo; is iron-grey in colour, has a very long body, and is extremely
intelligent and good natured.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 257]</span>On one of the artist&#8217;s visits, &ldquo;Beppo,&rdquo; a white Pomeranian, was brought out
to have his portrait taken. Dog-like, he at once pretended, when required to
sit still, that it was an excessively difficult operation causing great
physical discomfort. Talking did not interest him, shaking of keys and rolling
of coppers had lost their charm; in fact, tail between legs, he voted
existence a mistake. Just then, up strolled dear little &ldquo;Rona,&rdquo; and with
bright intelligent eyes seemingly enquired into the matter. In a few seconds
everything was put right again. The sun once more shone, and the portrait was
taken. Surely, these little Skyes are the most lovable and intelligent of all
dogs. To any one who has read &ldquo;Rab and his Friends,&rdquo; however, such a remark is
unnecessary.</p>

<p>In appearance, little tiny &ldquo;Gena&rdquo; bears the palm from all the Pomeranians.
She is one mass of white, silky wool, and has the most charming manners. With
one tiny paw uplifted she immediately decides that artists are not as
photographers, and may be trusted to take portraits without the intervention
of any snappy and nerve-shaking apparatus. &ldquo;Gena&rdquo; and &ldquo;Glen,&rdquo; an old black and
tan collie, live in the house, the inseparable companions of genial Mrs. Hugh
Brown.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 258]</span>The late Prince Consort&#8217;s favourite dogs were dachshunds, a specimen of which
invariably accompanied him on his walks. The Prince of Wales favours the
odd-looking bassets, of which he has many fine specimens.</p>

<p>But the kennels, with all their joyousness, have sad little tragedies at
times. For instance, after the death of the late well-loved Emperor Frederick,
two of his favourite Italian dogs, charming creatures, something like Italian
greyhounds, were sent to Her Majesty, but, unfortunately, did not long survive
their illustrious master. Many old pets have tombs in various parts of the
Royal domain. Among others which may be seen on the Slopes is that of
&ldquo;Sharp,&rdquo; a handsome collie, who lies, as in life, guarding the Queen&#8217;s glove.</p>

<p>It is related of &ldquo;Sharp&rdquo; that he was greatly attached to the late Mr. John
Brown, whose room he jealously guarded. If, by chance, strangers entered
during Mr. Brown&#8217;s absence they were not allowed to leave until his return,
and under no circumstances must anything be taken from the room while &ldquo;Sharp&rdquo;
was on guard. A housemaid, indeed, once picked up some little article with the
intention of putting it on the table, and the dog, although he knew her well,
refused to allow her to leave the room.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/img259.jpg" width="400" height="274" alt="the dogs" title="" />
</div>

<p>In noticing the display of prize certificates won by the dogs, we hear of
another instance of Her Majesty&#8217;s thoughtfulness for her pets. Although
frequently exhibited for the pleasure of her subjects, they are never allowed
to pass the night from home, being taken to and from the place of exhibition
each day by their careful guardians, Messrs. Brown and Hill.</p>

<p>After an inspection of the well-kept stud-book, we at last turn to leave the
happy scene, a process viewed, evidently, with much relief by a funny little,
black-faced pug, to whom our presence and proceedings throughout have
seemingly caused the greatest astonishment.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 259]</span></p>

<p>But we have still Her Majesty&#8217;s pets at the stables to look at before
returning to town, so we walk blithely down Herne&#8217;s Walk toward the Castle,
putting up a huge hare, who leisurely retreats as if feeling secure within the
Royal precincts. As we go down the walk, we notice a comparatively
juvenile-looking tree in marked contrast to the giants around. At its foot is
the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
This tree was planted by<br />
Her Majesty Queen Victoria<br />
To mark the spot where Herne&#8217;s Oak stood.<br />

</div><p>
<span style="margin-left: 16em;">There is an old tale goes that Herne the Hunter,<br /></span>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 260]</span>After lunch at the nearest hostelry, we walk up to the Castle, and enquire
for Mr. John Manning, the superintendent of the Royal mews. Mr. Manning first
takes us to the harness-room, a well-lighted, pleasant building with sanded
floor, a stove burning brightly in the centre of the room, and all round the
walls harness and saddles symmetrically arranged. The first set of double
harness which he shows us is seldom used, and is made out of black leather,
richly embroidered in designs of the Royal Arms, &amp;c., with split porcupine
quills, the work of some Tyrolese artists who visited this country many years
ago. Next to the porcupine harness hangs a set of Russian leather sledge
harness, beautifully mounted with silver, and as soft as a kid glove. High
over the saddles (the saddles are hung up with what is known as a crutch) are
the collars of the Queen&#8217;s carriage horses. In order to prevent confusion, the
name of each horse is printed above the collar, <em>i.e.</em>, &ldquo;True,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ronald,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sheridan,&rdquo; &ldquo;Beau,&rdquo; &ldquo;Force,&rdquo; &ldquo;Belfast,&rdquo; &ldquo;Middy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bashful,&rdquo; and so on.</p>

<p>Next door to the harness-room is a huge coach-house containing the Queen&#8217;s
carriages, among them being a landau, sociable, driving landau, waggonette,
and a driving phaeton with curtains, which was much used by the late Prince
Consort. In one corner is a covered perambulator belonging to Her Majesty&#8217;s
grandchildren, and close to it stands the vehicle which is generally known as
&ldquo;the Queen&#8217;s Chair,&rdquo; although it is in reality a little four-wheeled carriage,
with rubber tyres, and a low step, the interior lining and cushions being a
plain dark blue in colour.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/img261.jpg" width="400" height="285" alt="&quot;jacquot.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;jacquot.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>This vehicle is much used by Her Majesty when driving about the grounds, and
is drawn by an exceedingly strong, handsome donkey called &ldquo;Jacquot,&rdquo; in colour
a very dark brown, with white nose and curiously knotted tail. &ldquo;Jacquot,&rdquo; who
is a very intelligent animal, with a rather strong objection to work, and a
great love of good living, accompanies Her Majesty whenever she goes abroad,
his next destination being Florence.</p>

<p>In an adjoining paddock stands a nice, pleasant-looking grey donkey, who
munches an apple philosophically while having his portrait drawn. He is a
great favourite, the son of Egyptian &ldquo;Tewfik,&rdquo; and takes his share of garden
work and in carrying the Queen&#8217;s grandchildren.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 261]</span></p>

<p>The adjoining stable contains eighteen harness horses, most of them grey. The
stables themselves are beautifully kept, one groom being generally allowed to
every two horses. At the edge of each stall is an artistically plaited border
of straw. Close by is the riding school, a handsome building sixty-three yards
in length and eighteen yards wide. The roof is supported on handsome oak
brackets; at one end is a balcony where it is said Her Majesty and the late
Prince Consort were accustomed to sit and watch the horses being exercised. In
this gallery are medallions of favourite horses, the frames containing locks
of their hair. The riding school is lit with gas, and the lower part of the
walls lined with kamptulicon, which never wears out, and prevents a horse
being much injured should he by any chance kick or fall against it. The centre
of the tan-covered floor is occupied by a mounting block.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 336px;">

<span class="caption">a son of &quot;tewfik.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>This school is occasionally used for circus performances, and, splendidly
decorated, was the scene of the grand entertainment given to the Belgian
volunteers some years since.</p>

<p>In a solitary loose box, warmly wrapped in rugs, her own natural coat being
like very thick, soft, black plush, placidly stands &ldquo;Jessie,&rdquo; the Queen&#8217;s
favourite old riding-mare. With her splendid coat, silky mane and tail, lofty
crest, and soft mild eyes, she looks indeed worthy of her Royal mistress.
&ldquo;Jessie&#8217;s&rdquo; pedigree is unknown to us, but she was bred near Balmoral. She is
about fifteen hands three inches in height, black as a coal, and with peculiar
white markings on forehead and back. She is now twenty-six or twenty-seven
years old, and, until within the last twelve months, has carried Her Majesty
for many years. The Queen is very fond of &ldquo;Jessie,&rdquo; who, although now, from
old age, past work, is invariably sent to the Castle for inspection when Her
Majesty is at Windsor.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 262]</span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 424px;">
<img src="images/img263.jpg" width="424" height="500" alt="jessie" title="" />
</div>

<p>A very different-looking animal is the grey Arab in the next stable. This
magnificent horse was presented to Her Majesty by the Thakore of Morvi, and
does not bear the best of stable reputations, but when mounted he is docility
itself, and a very faithful worker. The grey&#8217;s wardrobe, when he came to
England, consisted of the following gorgeous trappings:&mdash;Saddle of red and
green cloth, under felt, pad for saddle, embroidered saddle-cloth, embroidered
bridle, plume, hood in cloth of gold, leg-ring and pad, embroidered neckpiece,
embroidered quarter-piece, four<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 263]</span> bunches of woollen tassels, and a silk scarf.
Arrayed in all this splendour and ridden by a native attendant, he was brought
into the Grand Quadrangle at Windsor to be presented to Her Majesty with due
and appropriate ceremonies. He is tall for an Arab, with whitish body, dark
grey legs, pink muzzle, and silky black mane, which hangs over the near or
left side of his neck. In the next stable stand twelve beautiful brougham
horses, ranging from dark brown to light chestnut in colour. Next to the
brougham horses are four brown ponies, about fourteen hands high. These
animals were all bred from a pony called &ldquo;Beatrice,&rdquo; which the Princess
Beatrice was accustomed to ride.</p>

<span class="caption">the grey arab.</span>
</div>

<p>In the next carriage-house stands a gorgeous <em>char-&agrave;-banc</em>, presented to Her
Majesty by Louis Philippe. Then come the carriages of the household, weighing
about fifteen hundredweight each. The most curious-looking vehicles, however,
are the long-shafted Russian droschkies, meant to be drawn by three horses
abreast.</p>

<p>In another carriage-house is a vehicle replete with historical and pathetic
interest. This is none other than the post-chaise in which Her Majesty and the
late Prince Consort travelled all through Germany about seven years after
their marriage. It is fitted up with a writing-case, and all sorts of
conveniences, and hung on C springs.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 264]</span></p>

<p>The cheerful tap-tap of a hammer, and a keen, pungent scent as of something
burning, warn us that we are in the vicinity of the Royal smithy. A handsome
grey carriage-horse is being shod, one hoof doubled up between the farrier&#8217;s
legs, as that worthy, with quick taps, drives in a long nail, and makes the
shoe fast.</p>

<p>The Royal mews, which were built in 1841, cover a space of no less than four
acres of ground, and, together with those at Buckingham Palace, are under the
able supervision of Colonel Sir George Maude, K.C.B., R.A., &amp;c., who also
purchases most of Her Majesty&#8217;s horses. It is no light testimonial to the care
of their management when we hear that, although sometimes as many as one
hundred horses are accommodated at Windsor, the veterinary surgeon&#8217;s account
only amounts for the year to a most insignificant sum.</p>

<p>We cannot take our leave, for the present, of the Royal pets without again
returning our hearty thanks to all with whom we have been brought in contact,
for their kindness, courtesy, and desire to assist us in our mission. To all
loyal subjects who wish to see a model of a good Queen&#8217;s home we can give no
better advice than to go to Royal Windsor.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;the wrongs of the working man.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>The public-houses of Burwell Road&mdash;and there were many of them for the length
of the street&mdash;were rather proud of Joe Hollends. He was a perfected specimen
of the work a pub produces. He was probably the most persistent drunkard the
Road possessed, and the periodical gathering in of Joe by the police was one
of the stock sights of the street. Many of the inhabitants could be taken to
the station by one policeman; some required two; but Joe&#8217;s average was four.
He had been heard to boast that on one occasion he had been accompanied to the
station by seven bobbies, but that was before the force had studied Joe and
got him down to his correct mathematical equivalent. Now they tripped him up,
a policeman taking one kicking leg and another the other, while the remaining
two attended to the upper part of his body. Thus they carried him, followed by
an admiring crowd, and watched by other envious drunkards who had to content
themselves with a single officer when they went on a similar spree. Sometimes
Joe managed to place a kick where it would do the most good against the
stomach of a policeman, and when the officer rolled over there was for a few
moments a renewal of the fight, silent on the part of the men and vociferous
on the part of the drunkard, who had a fine flow of abusive language. Then the
procession went on again. It was perfectly useless to put Joe on the police
ambulance, for it required two men to sit on him while in transit, and the
barrow is not made to stand such a load.</p>

<p>Of course, when Joe staggered out of the pub and fell in the gutter, the
ambulance did its duty, and trundled Joe to his abiding<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 267]</span> place, but the real
fun occurred when Joe was gathered in during the third stage of his debauch.
He passed through the oratorical stage, then the maudlin or sentimental stage,
from which he emerged into the fighting stage, when he was usually ejected
into the street, where he forthwith began to make Rome howl, and paint the
town red. At this point the policeman&#8217;s whistle sounded, and the force knew
Joe was on the warpath, and that duty called them to the fray.</p>

<p>It was believed in the neighbourhood that Joe had been a college man, and this
gave him additional standing with his admirers. His eloquence was undoubted,
after several glasses varying in number according to the strength of their
contents, and a man who had heard the great political speakers of the day
admitted that none of them could hold a candle to Joe when he got on the
subject of the wrongs of the working man and the tyranny of the capitalist. It
was generally understood that Joe might have been anything he liked, and that
he was no man&#8217;s enemy but his own. It was also hinted that he could tell the
bigwigs a thing or two if he had been consulted in affairs of State.</p>

<p>One evening, when Joe was slowly progressing as usual, with his feet in the
air, towards the station, supported by the requisite number of policemen, and
declaiming to the delight of the accompanying crowd, a woman stood with her
back to the brick wall, horror-stricken at the sight. She had a pale, refined
face, and was dressed in black. Her self-imposed mission was among these
people, but she had never seen Joe taken to the station before, and the sight,
which was so amusing to the neighbourhood, was shocking to her. She enquired
about Joe, and heard the usual story that he was no man&#8217;s enemy but his own,
although they might in justice have added the police. Still, a policeman was
hardly looked upon as a human being in that neighbourhood. Miss Johnson
reported the case to the committee of the Social League, and took counsel.
Then it was that the reclamation of Joe Hollends was determined on.</p>

<p>Joe received Miss Johnson with subdued dignity, and a demeanour that
delicately indicated a knowledge on his part of her superiority and his own
degradation. He knew how a lady should be treated even if he was a drunkard,
as he told his cronies afterwards. Joe was perfectly willing to be reclaimed.
Heretofore in his life, no one had ever extended the hand of fellowship to
him. Human sympathy was what Joe needed, and precious little he had had of it.
There were more kicks than halfpence in this world for<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 268]</span> a poor man. The rich
did not care what became of the poor; not they&mdash;a proposition which Miss
Johnson earnestly denied.</p>

<p>It was one of the tenets of the committee that where possible the poor should
help the poor. It was resolved to get Joe a decent suit of clothes and
endeavour to find him a place where work would enable him to help himself.
Miss Johnson went around the neighbourhood and collected pence for the
reclamation. Most people were willing to help Joe, although it was generally
felt that the Road would be less gay when he took on sober habits. In one
room, however, Miss Johnson was refused the penny she pleaded for.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 370px;">
<img src="images/img269.jpg" width="370" height="500" alt="&quot;we cannot spare even a penny.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;we cannot spare even a penny.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;We cannot spare even a penny,&rdquo; said the woman, whose sickly little boy clung
to her skirts. &ldquo;My husband is just out of work again. He has had only four
weeks&#8217; work this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Johnson looked around the room and saw why there was no money. It was
quite evident where the earnings of the husband had gone.</p>

<p>The room was much better furnished than the average apartment of the
neighbourhood. There were two sets of dishes where one would have been quite
sufficient. On the mantelshelf and around the walls were various unnecessary
articles which cost money.</p>

<p>Miss Johnson noted all this but said nothing, although she resolved to report
it to the committee. In union is strength and in multitude of counsel there is
wisdom. Miss Johnson had great faith in the wisdom of the committee.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 269]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How long has your husband been out of work?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only a few days, but times are very bad and he is afraid he will not get
another situation soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is his trade?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a carpenter and a good workman&mdash;sober and steady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you give me his name I will put it down in our books. Perhaps we may be
able to help him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;John Morris is his name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Johnson wrote it down on her tablets, and when she left the wife felt
vaguely grateful for benefits to come.</p>

<p>The facts of the case were reported to the committee, and Miss Johnson was
deputed to expostulate with Mrs. Morris upon her extravagance. John Morris&#8217;s
name was put upon the books among the names of many other unemployed persons.
The case of Joe Hollends then came up, and elicited much enthusiasm. A decent
suit of clothing had been purchased with part of the money collected for him,
and it was determined to keep the rest in trust, to be doled out to him as
occasion warranted.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 363px;">
<img src="images/img270.jpg" width="363" height="500" alt="&quot;the ladies were very persuasive.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;the ladies were very persuasive.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Two persuasive ladies undertook to find a place for him in one of the
factories, if such a thing were possible.</p>

<p>Joe felt rather uncomfortable in his new suit of clothes, and seemed to regard
the expenditure as, all in all, a waste of good money. He was also
disappointed to find that the funds collected were not to be handed over to
him in a lump. It was not the money he cared about, he said, but the evident
lack of trust. If people had trusted him more, he might have been a better
man. Trust and human sympathy were what Joe Hollends needed.</p>

<p>The two persuasive ladies appealed to Mr. Stillwell, the proprietor of a small
factory for the making of boxes. They said that if Hollends got a chance they
were sure he would reform. Stillwell replied that he had no place for anyone.
He had enough to do to keep the men already in his employ. Times were dull in
the box business, and he was turning away applicants every day<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 270]</span> who were good
workmen and who didn&#8217;t need to be reformed. However, the ladies were very
persuasive, and it is not given to every man to be able to refuse the appeal
of a pretty woman, not to mention two of them. Stillwell promised to give
Hollends a chance, said he would consult with his foreman, and let the ladies
know what could be done.</p>

<p>Joe Hollends did not receive the news of his luck with the enthusiasm that
might have been expected. Many a man was tramping London in search of
employment and finding none, therefore even the ladies who were so solicitous
about Joe&#8217;s welfare thought he should be thankful that work came unsought. He
said he would do his best, which is, when you come to think of it, all that we
have a right to expect from any man.</p>

<p>Some days afterwards Jack Morris applied to Mr. Stillwell for a job, but he
had no sub-committee of persuasive ladies to plead for him. He would be
willing to work half-time or quarter-time for that matter. He had a wife and
boy dependent on him. He could show that he was a good workman and he did not
drink. Thus did Morris recite his qualifications to the unwilling ears of
Stillwell the box maker. As he left the place disheartened with another
refusal, he was overtaken by Joe Hollends. Joe was a lover of his fellow-man,
and disliked seeing anyone downhearted. He had one infallible cure for
dejection. Having just been discharged, he was in high spirits, because his
prediction of his own failure as a reformed character, if work were a
condition of the reclamation, had just been fulfilled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cheer up, old man,&rdquo; he cried, slapping Morris on the shoulder, &ldquo;what&#8217;s the
matter? Come and have a drink with me. I&#8217;ve got the money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Morris, who knew the professional drunkard but slightly, and did
not care for further acquaintance with him, &ldquo;I want work, not beer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every man to his taste. Why don&#8217;t you ask at the box factory? You can have my
job and welcome. The foreman&#8217;s just discharged me. Said I wouldn&#8217;t work
myself, and kept the men off theirs. Thought I talked too much about capital
and labour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think I could get your job?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very likely. No harm in trying. If they don&#8217;t take you on, come into the Red
Lion&mdash;I&#8217;ll be there&mdash;and have a drop. It&#8217;ll cheer you up a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;he found hollends ready to welcome him.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Morris appealed in vain to the foreman. They had more men<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 271]</span> now in the factory
than they needed, he said. So Morris went to the Red Lion, where he found
Hollends ready to welcome him. They had several glasses together, and Hollends
told him of the efforts of the Social League in the reclamation line, and his
doubts of their ultimate success. Hollends seemed to think the ladies of the
League were deeply indebted to him for furnishing them with such a good
subject for reformation. That night Joe&#8217;s career reached a triumphant climax,
for the four policemen had to appeal to the bystanders for help in the name of
the law.</p>

<p>Jack Morris went home unaided. He had not taken many glasses, but he knew he
should have avoided drink altogether, for he had some experience of its power
in his younger days. He was, therefore, in a quarrelsome mood, ready to blame
everyone but himself.</p>

<p>He found his wife in tears, and saw Miss Johnson sitting there, evidently very
miserable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s all this?&rdquo; asked Morris.</p>

<p>His wife dried her eyes, and said it was nothing. Miss Johnson had been giving
her some advice, which she was thankful for. Morris glared at the visitor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you got to do with us?&rdquo; he demanded rudely. His wife caught him by
the arm, but he angrily tossed aside her hand. Miss Johnson arose, fearing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;ve no business here. We want none of your advice. You get out of this.&rdquo;
Then, impatiently to his wife, who strove to calm him, &ldquo;Shut up, will you?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 272]</span></p>

<p>Miss Johnson was afraid he would strike her as she passed him going to the
door, but he merely stood there, following her exit with lowering brow.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/img273.png" width="600" height="400" alt="&quot;told her experience.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;told her experience.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>The terrified lady told her experience to the sympathising members of the
committee. She had spoken to Mrs. Morris of her extravagance in buying so many
things that were not necessary when her husband had work. She advised the
saving of the money. Mrs. Morris had defended her apparent lavish expenditure
by saying that there was no possibility of saving money. She bought useful
things, and when her husband was out of work she could always get a large
percentage of their cost from the pawnbroker. The pawnshop, she had tearfully
explained to Miss Johnson, was the only bank of the poor. The idea of the
pawnshop as a bank, and not as a place of disgrace, was new to Miss Johnson,
but before anything further could be said the husband had come in. One of the
committee, who knew more about the district than Miss Johnson, affirmed that
there was something to say for the pawnbroker as the banker of the poor. The
committee were unanimous in condemning the conduct of Morris, and it says much
for the members that, in spite of the provocation one of them had received,
they did not take the name of so undeserving a man from their list of the
unemployed.</p>

<p>The sad relapse of Joe Hollends next occupied the attention of<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 273]</span> the League.
His fine had been paid, and he had expressed himself as deeply grieved at his
own frailty. If the foreman had been less harsh with him and had given him a
chance, things might have been different. It was resolved to send Joe to the
seaside so that he might have an opportunity of toning up his system to resist
temptation. Joe enjoyed his trip to the sea. He always liked to encounter a
new body of police unaccustomed to his methods. He toned up his system so
successfully the first day on the sands that he spent the night in the cells.</p>

<p>Little by little, the portable property in the rooms of the Morrises
disappeared into the pawnshop. Misfortune, as usual, did not come singly. The
small boy was ill, and Morris himself seemed to be unable to resist the
temptation of the Red Lion. The unhappy woman took her boy to the parish
doctor, who was very busy, but he gave what attention he could to the case. He
said all the boy needed was nourishing food and country air. Mrs. Morris
sighed, and decided to take the little boy oftener to the park, but the way
was long, and he grew weaker day by day.</p>

<p>At last, she succeeded in interesting her husband in the little fellow&#8217;s
condition. He consented to take the boy to the doctor with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The doctor doesn&#8217;t seem to mind what I say,&rdquo; she complained. &ldquo;Perhaps he will
pay attention to a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morris was not naturally a morose person, but continued disappointment was
rapidly making him so. He said nothing, but took the boy in his arms, and,
followed by his wife, went to the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This boy was here before,&rdquo; said the physician, which tended to show that he
had paid more attention to the case than Mrs. Morris thought. &ldquo;He is very much
worse. You will have to take him to the country or he will die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I send him to the country?&rdquo; asked Morris, sullenly. &ldquo;I&#8217;ve been out of
work for months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you friends in the country?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hasn&#8217;t your wife any friends in the country who would take her and the lad
for a month or so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you anything to pawn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I would advise you to pawn everything you own, or sell it if you can,
and take the boy on your back and tramp to the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 274]</span> country. You will get work
there probably more easily than in the city. Here are ten shillings to help
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t want your money,&rdquo; said Morris, in a surly tone. &ldquo;I want work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no work to give you, so I offer you what I have. I haven&#8217;t as much of
that as I could wish. You are a fool not to take what the gods send.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morris, without replying, gathered up his son in his arms and departed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is a bottle of tonic for him,&rdquo; said the doctor to Mrs. Morris.</p>

<p>He placed the half-sovereign on the bottle as he passed it to her. She
silently thanked him with her wet eyes, hoping that a time would come when she
could repay the money. The doctor had experience enough to know that they were
not to be classed among his usual visitors. He was not in the habit of
indiscriminately bestowing gold coins.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 470px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;here is a tonic for him.&#39;&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>It was a dreary journey, and they were a long time shaking off the
octopus-like tentacles of the great city, that reached further and further
into the country each year, as if it lived on consuming the green fields.
Morris walked ahead with the boy on his back, and his wife followed. Neither
spoke, and the sick lad did not complain. As they were nearing a village, the
boy&#8217;s head sunk on his father&#8217;s shoulder. The mother quickened her pace, and
came up to them, stroking the head of her sleeping son. Suddenly, she uttered
a smothered cry and took the boy in her arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Morris, turning round.</p>

<p>She did not answer, but sat by the roadside with the boy on<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 275]</span> her lap, swaying
her body to and fro over him, moaning as she did so. Morris needed no answer.
He stood on the road with hardening face, and looked down on his wife and
child without speaking.</p>

<p>The kindly villagers arranged the little funeral, and when it was over Jack
Morris and his wife stood again on the road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack, dear,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;don&#8217;t go back to that horrible place. We belong to
the country, and the city is so hard and cruel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m going back. You can do as you like.&rdquo; Then, relenting a little, he added,
&ldquo;I haven&#8217;t brought much luck to you, my girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She knew her husband was a stubborn man, and set in his way, so, unprotesting,
she followed him in, as she had followed him out, stumbling many times, for
often her eyes did not see the road. And so they returned to their empty
rooms.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 630px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;it was a glorious victory.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Jack Morris went to look for work at the Red Lion. There he met that genial
comrade, Joe Hollends, who had been reformed, and who had backslid twice since
Jack had foregathered with him before. It is but fair to Joe to admit that he
had never been optimistic about his own reclamation, but, being an obliging
man, even when he was sober, he was willing to give the Social League every
chance. Jack was deeply grieved at the death of his son, although he had said
no word to his wife that would show it. It therefore took more liquor than
usual to bring him up to the point of good comradeship that reigned at the Red
Lion. When he<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 276]</span> and Joe left the tavern that night it would have taken an
expert to tell which was the more inebriated. They were both in good fighting
trim, and both were in the humour for a row. The police, who had reckoned on
Joe alone, suddenly found a new element in the fight that not only upset their
calculations but themselves as well. It was a glorious victory, and, as both
fled down a side street, Morris urged Hollends to come along, for the
representatives of law and order have the habit of getting reinforcements
which often turn a victory into a most ignominious defeat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&#8217;t,&rdquo; panted Hollends. &ldquo;The beggars have hurt me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come along. I know a place where we are safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drunk as he was, Jack succeeded in finding the hole in the wall that allowed
him to enter a vacant spot behind the box factory. There Hollends lay down
with a groan, and there Morris sank beside him in a drunken sleep. The police
were at last revenged, and finally.</p>

<p>When the grey daylight brought Morris to a dazed sense of where he was, he
found his companion dead beside him. He had a vague fear that he would be
tried for murder, but it was not so. From the moment that Hollends, in his
fall, struck his head on the kerb, the Providence which looks after the
drunken deserted him.</p>

<p>But the inquest accomplished one good object. It attracted the attention of
the Social League to Jack Morris, and they are now endeavouring to reclaim
him.</p>

<p>Whether they succeed or not, he was a man that was certainly once worth
saving.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 277]</span></p>

<p>I think that it was in an article by a fellow-scribe, where, doubtless more in
sorrow than in anger, that gentleman exposed the worthlessness of the
productions of sundry of his brother authors, in which I read that whatever
success I had met with as a writer of fiction was due to my literary friends
and &ldquo;nepotic criticism.&rdquo; This is scarcely the case, since when I began to
write I do not think that I knew a single creature who had published
books&mdash;blue books alone excepted. Nobody was ever more outside the ring, or
less acquainted with the art of &ldquo;rolling logs,&rdquo; than the humble individual who
pens these lines. But the reader shall judge for himself.</p>

<p>To begin at the beginning: My very first attempt at imaginative writing was
made while I was a boy at school. One of the masters promised a prize to that
youth who should best describe on paper any incident, real or imaginary. I
entered the lists, and selected the scene at an operation in a hospital as my
subject. The fact that I had never seen an operation, nor crossed the doors of
a hospital, did not deter me from this bold<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 279]</span> endeavour, which, however, was
justified by its success. I was declared to have won in the competition,
though, probably through the forgetfulness of the master, I remember that I
never received the promised prize. My next literary effort, written in 1876,
was an account of a Zulu war dance, which I witnessed when I was on the staff
of the Governor of Natal. It was published in the <em>Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine</em>, and
very kindly noticed in various papers. A year later I wrote another article,
entitled &ldquo;A Visit to the Chief Secocoeni,&rdquo; which appeared in <em>Macmillan</em>, and
very nearly got me into trouble. I was then serving on the staff of Sir
Theophilus Shepstone, and the article, signed with my initials, reached South
Africa in its printed form shortly after the annexation of the Transvaal.
Young men with a pen in their hands are proverbially indiscreet, and in this
instance I was no exception. In the course of my article I had described the
Transvaal Boer at home with a fidelity that should be avoided by members of a
diplomatic mission, and had even gone the length of saying that most of the
Dutch women were &ldquo;fat.&rdquo; Needless to say, my remarks were translated into the
Africander papers, and somewhat extensively read, especially by the ladies in
question and their male relatives; nor did the editors of those papers forbear
to comment on them in leading articles. Shortly afterwards, there was a great
and stormy meeting of Boers at Pretoria. As matters began to look serious,
somebody ventured among them to ascertain the exciting cause, and returned
with the pleasing intelligence that they were all talking of what the
Englishman had written about the physical proportions of their womenkind and
domestic habits, and threatening to take up arms to avenge it. Of my feelings
on learning this<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 280]</span> news I will not discourse, but they were uncomfortable, to
say the least of it. Happily, in the end, the gathering broke up without
bloodshed, but when the late Sir Bartle Frere came to Pretoria, some months
afterwards, he administered to me a sound and well-deserved lecture on my
indiscretion. I excused myself by saying that I had set down nothing which was
not strictly true, and he replied to the effect that therein lay my fault. I
quite agree with him; indeed, there is little doubt but that these bald
statements of fact as to the stoutness of the Transvaal &ldquo;fraus,&rdquo; and the lack
of cleanliness in their homes, went near to precipitating a result that, as it
chanced, was postponed for several years. Well, it is all done with now, and I
take this opportunity of apologising to such of the ladies in question as may
still be in the land of life.</p>

<span class="caption">the back garden.</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 281]</span>This unfortunate experience cooled my literary ardour, yet, as it chanced,
when some five years later I again took up my pen, it was in connection with
African affairs. These pages are no place for politics, but I must allude to
them in explanation. It will be remembered that the Transvaal was annexed by
Great Britain in 1877. In 1881 the Boers rose in rebellion and administered
several thrashings to our troops, whereon the Government of this country came
suddenly to the conclusion that a wrong had been done to the victors, and
subject to some paper restrictions, gave them back their independence. As it
chanced, at the time I was living on some African property belonging to me in
the centre of the operations, and so disgusted was I, in common with thousands
of others, at the turn which matters had taken, that I shook the dust of South
Africa off my feet and returned to England. Now, the first impulse of an
aggrieved Englishman is to write to the <em>Times</em>, and if I remember right I
took this course, but my letter not being inserted, I enlarged upon the idea
and composed a book called &ldquo;Cetewayo and his White Neighbours.&rdquo; This
semi-political work, or rather history, was very carefully constructed from
the records of some six years&#8217; experience, and by the help of a shelf full of
blue books that stare me in the face as I write these words; and the fact that
it still goes on selling seems to show that it has some value in the eyes of
students of South African politics. But when I had written my book I was
confronted by a difficulty which I had not anticipated, being utterly without
experience in such affairs&mdash;that of finding somebody willing to publish it. I
remember that I purchased a copy of the <em>Athen&aelig;um</em>, and selecting the names of
various firms at hazard, wrote to them offering to submit my manuscript, but,
strange to say, none of them seemed anxious to peruse it. At last&mdash;how I do
not recollect&mdash;it came into the hands of Messrs. Tr&uuml;bner, who, after
consideration, wrote to say that they were willing to bring it out on the half
profit system, provided that I paid down fifty pounds towards the cost of
production. I did not at all like the idea of parting with the fifty pounds,
but I believed in my book, and was anxious to put my views on the Transvaal
rebellion and other African questions before the world. So I consented to the
terms, and in due course Cetewayo was published in a neat green binding.
Somewhat to my astonishment, it proved a success from a literary point of
view. It was not largely purchased&mdash;indeed, that fifty pounds took several
years on its return journey to my pocket, but it was favourably, and in some
instances almost enthusiastically, reviewed, especially in the colonial
papers.</p>

</div>

<p>About this time the face of a girl whom I saw in a church at Norwood gave me
the idea of writing a novel. The face was so perfectly beautiful, and at the
same time so refined, that I felt I could fit a story to it which should be
worthy of a heroine similarly endowed. When next I saw Mr. Tr&uuml;bner I consulted
him on the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can write&mdash;it is certain that you can write. Yes, do it, and I will get
the book published for you,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>Thus encouraged I set to work. How to compose a novel I knew not, so I wrote
straight on, trusting to the light of nature to guide me. My main object was
to produce the picture of a woman perfect in mind and body, and to show her
character ripening and growing spiritual, under the pressure of various
afflictions. Of course, there is a vast gulf between a novice&#8217;s aspiration and
his<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 282]</span> attainment, and I do not contend that Angela as she appears in &ldquo;Dawn&rdquo;
fulfils this ideal; also, such a person in real life might, and probably
would, be a bore&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="caption">the hall.</span>
</div>

<p>Still, this was the end I aimed at. Indeed, before I had done with her, I
became so deeply attached to my heroine that, in a literary sense, I have
never quite got over it. I worked very hard at this novel during the next six
months or so, but at length it was finished and despatched to Mr. Tr&uuml;bner,
who, as his firm did not deal in this class of book, submitted it to five or
six of the best publishers of fiction. One and all they declined it, so that
by degrees it became clear to me that I might as well have saved my labour.
Mr. Tr&uuml;bner, however, had confidence in my work, and submitted the manuscript
to Mr. John Cordy Jeaffreson for report; and here I may pause to say that I
think there is more kindness in the hearts of literary men than is common in
the world. It is not a pleasant task, in the face of repeated failure, again
and again to attempt the adventure of persuading brother publishers to
undertake the maiden effort of an unknown man. Still less pleasant is it, as I
can vouch from experience, to wade through a lengthy and not particularly
legible manuscript, and write an elaborate opinion thereon for the benefit of
a stranger. Yet Mr. Tr&uuml;bner and Mr. Jeaffreson did these things for me without
fee or reward. Mr. Jeaffreson&#8217;s report I have lost or mislaid, but I remember
its purport well. It was to the effect that there was a great deal of power in
the novel, but that it required to be entirely re-written. The first part he
thought so good that he advised me to expand it, and the unhappy ending he
could not agree with. If I killed the heroine, it would kill the book, he
said. He may have been right, but I still hold to<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 283]</span> my first conception,
according to which Angela was doomed to an early and pathetic end, as the
fittest crown to her career. That the story needed re-writing there is no
doubt, but I believe that it would have been better as a work of art if I had
dealt with it on the old lines, especially as the expansion of the beginning,
in accordance with the advice of my kindly critic, took the tale back through
the history of another generation&mdash;always a most dangerous experiment. Still,
I did as I was told, not presuming to set up a judgment of my own in the
matter. If I had worked hard at the first draft of the novel, I worked much
harder at the second, especially as I could not give all my leisure to it,
being engaged at the time in reading for the Bar. So hard did I work that at
length my eyesight gave out, and I was obliged to complete the last hundred
sheets in a darkened room. But let my eyes ache as they might, I would not
give up till it was finished, within about three months from the date of its
commencement. Recently, I went through this book to prepare it for a new
edition, chiefly in order to cut out some of the mysticism and tall writing,
for which it is too remarkable, and was pleased to find that it still
interested me. But if a writer may be allowed to criticise his own work, it is
two books, not one. Also, the hero is a very poor creature. Evidently I was
too much occupied with my heroines to give much thought to him; moreover,
women are so much easier and more interesting to write about, for whereas no
two of them are alike, in modern men, or rather, in young men of the middle
and upper classes, there is a paralysing sameness. As a candid friend once
said to me, &ldquo;There is nothing manly about that chap, Arthur&rdquo;&mdash;he is the
hero&mdash;&ldquo;except his bull-dog!&rdquo; With Angela herself I am still in love; only she
ought to have died, which, on the whole, would have been a better fate than
being married to Arthur, more especially if he was anything like the
illustrator&#8217;s conception of him.</p>

<p>In its new shape &ldquo;Dawn&rdquo; was submitted to Messrs. Hurst and Blackett, and at
once accepted by that firm. Why it was called &ldquo;Dawn&rdquo; I am not now quite clear,
but I think it was because I could find no other title acceptable to the
publishers. The discovery of suitable titles is a more difficult matter than
people who do not write romances would suppose, most of the good ones having
been used already and copyrighted. In due course the novel was published in
three fat volumes, and a pretty green cover, and I sat down to await events.
At the best I did not expect to win a fortune out of it, as if every one of
the five<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 284]</span> hundred copies printed were sold, I could only make fifty pounds
under my agreement&mdash;not an extravagant reward for a great deal of labour. As a
matter of fact, but four hundred and fifty sold, so the net proceeds of the
venture amounted to ten pounds only, and forty surplus copies of the book,
which I bored my friends by presenting to them. But as the copyright of the
work reverted to me at the expiration of a year, I cannot grumble at this
result. The reader may think that it was mercenary of me to consider my first
book from this financial point of view, but to be frank, though the story
interested me much in its writing, and I had a sneaking belief in its merits,
it never occurred to me that I, an utterly inexperienced beginner, could hope
to make any mark in competition with the many brilliant writers of fiction who
were already before the public. Therefore, so far as I was concerned, any
reward in the way of literary reputation seemed to be beyond my reach.</p>

</div>

<p>It was on the occasion of the publication of this novel that I made my first
and last attempt to &ldquo;roll a log,&rdquo; with somewhat amusing results. Almost the
only person of influence whom I knew in<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 285]</span> the world of letters was the editor
of a certain society paper. I had not seen him for ten years, but at this
crisis I ventured to recall myself to his memory, and to ask him, not for a
favourable notice, but that the book should be reviewed in his journal. He
acceded to my prayer; it was reviewed, but after a fashion for which I did not
bargain. This little incident taught me a lesson, and the moral of it is:
never trouble an editor about your immortal works; he can so easily be even
with you. I commend it to all literary tyros. Even if you are in a position to
command &ldquo;puffs,&rdquo; the public will find you out in the second edition, and
revenge itself upon your next book. Here is a story that illustrates the
accuracy of this statement; it came to me on good authority, and I believe it
to be true. A good many years ago, the relation of an editor of a great paper
published a novel. It was a bad novel, but a desperate effort was made to
force it upon the public, and in many of the leading journals appeared notices
so laudatory that readers fell into the trap, and the book went through
several editions. Encouraged by success, the writer published a second book,
but the public had found her out, and it fell flat. Being a person of
resource, she brought out a third work under a <em>nom de plume</em>, which, as at
first, was accorded an enthusiastic reception by previous arrangement, and
forced into circulation. A fourth followed under the same name, but again the
public had found her out, and her career as a novelist came to an end.</p>

<p>To return to the fate of &ldquo;Dawn.&rdquo; In most quarters it met with the usual
reception of a first novel by an unknown man. Some of the reviewers sneered at
it, and some &ldquo;slated&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 286]</span> it, and made merry over the misprints&mdash;a cheap form of
wit that saves those who practise it the trouble of going into the merits of a
book. Two very good notices fell to its lot, however, in the <em>Times</em> and in
the <em>Morning Post</em>, the first of these speaking about the novel in terms of
which any amateur writer might feel proud, though, unfortunately, it appeared
too late to be of much service. Also, I discovered that the story had
interested a great many readers, and none of them more than the late Mr.
Tr&uuml;bner, through whose kind offices it came to be published, who, I was told,
paid me the strange compliment of continuing its perusal till within a few
hours of his death, a sad event that the enemy might say was hastened thereby.
In this connection I remember that the first hint I received that my story was
popular with the ordinary reading public, whatever reviewers might say of it,
came from the lips of a young lady, a chance visitor at my house, whose name I
have forgotten. Seeing the book lying on the table, she took a volume up,
saying&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, have you read &lsquo;Dawn&rsquo;? It is a first-rate novel, I have just finished it.&rdquo;
Somebody explained, and the subject dropped, but I was not a little gratified
by the unintended compliment.</p>

<span class="caption">a study corner.</span>
</div>

<p>These facts encouraged me, and I wrote a second novel&mdash;&ldquo;The Witch&#8217;s Head.&rdquo;
This book I endeavoured to publish serially by posting the MS. to the editors
of various magazines for their consideration. But in those days there were no
literary agents or Authors&#8217; Societies to help young writers with their
experience and advice, and the bulky manuscript always came back to my hand
like a boomerang, till at length I wearied of the attempt. Of course I sent it
to the wrong people; afterwards the editor of a leading monthly told me that
he would have been delighted to run the book had it fallen into the hands of
his firm. In the end, as in the case of &ldquo;Dawn,&rdquo; I published &ldquo;The Witch&#8217;s Head&rdquo;
in three<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 287]</span> volumes. Its reception astonished me, for I did not think so well of
the book as I had done of its predecessor. In that view, by the way, the
public has borne out my judgment, for to this day three copies of &ldquo;Dawn&rdquo; are
absorbed for every two of &ldquo;The Witch&#8217;s Head,&rdquo; a proportion that has never
varied since the two works appeared in one volume form.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Witch&#8217;s Head&rdquo; was very well reviewed; indeed, in one or two cases, the
notices were almost enthusiastic, most of all when they dealt with the African
part of the book, which I had inserted as padding, the fight between Jeremy
and the Boer giant being singled out for especial praise. Whatever it may
lack, one merit this novel has, however, that was overlooked by all the
reviewers. Omitting the fictitious incidents introduced for the purposes of
the story, it contains an accurate account of the great disaster inflicted
upon our troops by the Zulus at Isandhlwana. I was in the country at the time
of the massacre, and heard its story from the lips of survivors, also, in
writing of it, I studied the official reports in the blue books and the
minutes of the Court Martial.</p>

<span class="caption">mr. rider haggard.</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;The Witch&#8217;s Head&rdquo; attained the dignity of being pirated in America, and in
England went out of print in a few weeks, but no argument that I could use
would induce my publishers to re-issue it in a one-volume edition. The risk
was too great, they said. Then it was I came to the conclusion that I would
abandon the making of books. The work was very hard, and when put to the test
of experience the glamour that surrounds this occupation vanished. I did not
care much for the publicity it involved, and, like most young authors, I
failed to appreciate being sneered at by anonymous critics who happened not to
care for what I wrote, and whom I had no opportunity of answering. It is true
that then, as now, I liked the work for its own sake. Indeed, I have always
thought that literature would be a charming profession<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 288]</span> if its conditions
allowed of the depositing of manuscripts, when completed, in a drawer, there
to languish in obscurity, or of their private publication only. But I could
not afford myself these luxuries. I was too modest to hope for any renown
worth having, and for the rest the game seemed scarcely worth the candle. I
had published a history and two novels. On the history I had lost fifty
pounds, on the first novel I had made ten pounds, and on the second fifty; net
profit on the three, ten pounds, which in the case of a man with other
occupations and duties did not appear to be an adequate return for the labour
involved. But I was not destined to escape thus from the toils of romance. One
day I chanced to read a clever article in favour of boys&#8217; books, and it
occurred to me that I might be able to do as well as others in that line. I
was working at the Bar at the time, but in my spare evenings, more for
amusement than from any other reason, I entered on the literary adventure that
ended in the appearance of &ldquo;King Solomon&#8217;s Mines.&rdquo; This romance has proved
very successful, although three firms, including my own publishers, refused
even to consider it. But as it can scarcely be called one of my first books, I
shall not speak of it here.</p>

</div>

<p>In conclusion, I will tell a moving tale, that it may be a warning to young
authors for ever. After my publishers declined to issue &ldquo;The Witch&#8217;s Head&rdquo; in
a six-shilling edition, I tried many others without success, and at length in
my folly signed an agreement with a firm since deceased. Under this document
the firm in question agreed to bring out &ldquo;Dawn&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Witch&#8217;s Head&rdquo; in a
two-shilling edition, and generously to remunerate me with a third share in
the profits realised, if any. In return for<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 289]</span> this concession, I on my part
undertook to allow the said firm to republish any novel that I might write,
for a period of five years from the date of the agreement, in a two-shilling
form, and on the same third-profit terms. Of course, so soon as the success of
&ldquo;King Solomon&#8217;s Mines&rdquo; was established, I received a polite letter from the
publishers in question, asking when they might expect to republish that
romance at two shillings. Then the matter came under the consideration of
lawyers and other skilled persons, with the result that it appeared that, if
the Courts took a strict view of the agreement, ruin stared me in the face, so
far as my literary affairs were concerned. To begin with, either by accident
or design, this artful document was so worded that, <em>prima facie</em>, the
contracting publisher had a right to place his cheap edition on the market
whenever it might please him to do so, subject only to the payment of a third
of the profit, to be assessed by himself, which practically would have meant
nothing at all. How could I expect to dispose of work subject to such a legal
&ldquo;servitude.&rdquo; For five long years I was a slave to the framer of the &ldquo;hanging&rdquo;
clause of the agreement. Things looked black indeed, when, thanks to the
diplomacy of my agent, and to a fortunate change in the <em>personnel</em> of the
firm to which I was bound, I avoided disaster. The fatal agreement was
cancelled, and in consideration of my release I undertook to write two books
upon a moderate royalty. Thus, then, did I escape out of bondage. To be just,
it was my own fault that I should ever have been sold into it, but authors are
proverbially guileless when they are anxious to publish their books, and a
piece of printed paper with a<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 290]</span> few additions written in a neat hand looks
innocent enough. Now no such misfortunes need happen, for the Authors&#8217; Society
is ready and anxious to protect them from themselves and others, but in those
days it did not exist.</p>

</div>

<p>This is the history of how I drifted into the writing of books. If it saves
one beginner so inexperienced and unfriended as I was in those days from
putting his hand to a &ldquo;hanging&rdquo; agreement under any circumstances whatsoever,
it will not have been set out in vain.</p>

<p>The advice that I give to would-be authors, if I may presume to offer it, is
to think for a long while before they enter at all upon a career so hard and
hazardous, but having entered on it, not to be easily cast down. There are
great virtues in perseverance, even though critics sneer and publishers prove
unkind.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 291]</span></p>

THE CAT&#8217;S REVENGE.

<p>We had been discussing the Darwinian hypothesis, and the Colonel had
maintained a profound silence, which was sufficient evidence that he did not
believe in the development of man from the lower animals. Some one, however,
asked him plumply his opinion of Darwinianism, and he sententiously replied,
&ldquo;Darned nonsense.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 343px;">
<img src="images/img292.jpg" width="343" height="400" alt="&quot;darned nonsense.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;darned nonsense.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Feeling that this view of the matter possibly merited expansion, the Colonel
caused his chair to assume its customary oratorical attitude on its two rear
legs, and began to discourse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are some things,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;which do look as if there might be a
grain of truth in this monkey theory. For instance, when I was in France I was
pretty nearly convinced that the monkey is the connecting link between man and
the Frenchmen, but after all there is no proof of it. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s the matter
with Darwinianism. When you produce a man who can remember that his
grandfather was a monkey, or when you show me a monkey that can produce papers
to prove that he is my second cousin, I&#8217;ll believe all Darwin said on the
subject, but as the thing stands I&#8217;ve nothing but Darwin&#8217;s word to prove that
men and monkeys are near relations. So far as I can learn, Darwin didn&#8217;t know
as much about animals as a man ought to know who undertakes to<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 292]</span> invent a
theory about them. He never was intimate with dogs, and he never drove an army
mule. He had a sort of bowing acquaintance with monkeys and a few other
animals of no particular standing in the community, but he couldn&#8217;t even
understand a single animal language. Now, if he had gone to work, and learned
to read and write, and speak the monkey language, as that American professor
that you were just speaking of has done, he might have been able to give us
some really valuable information.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I believe that animals talk? I don&#8217;t simply believe it, I know it. When I
was a young man I had a good deal to do with animals, and I learned to
understand the cat language just as well as I understood English. It&#8217;s an easy
language when once you get the hang of it, and from what I hear of German the
two are considerably alike. You look as if you didn&#8217;t altogether believe me,
though why you should doubt that a man can learn cat language when the world
is full of men that pretend to have learned German, and nobody calls their
word in question, I don&#8217;t precisely see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, I don&#8217;t pretend to understand all the cat dialects. For example, I
don&#8217;t know a word of the Angora dialect, and can only understand a sentence
here and there of the tortoiseshell dialect, but so far as good, pure standard
cat language goes, it&#8217;s as plain as print to me to-day, though I haven&#8217;t paid
any attention to it for forty years. I don&#8217;t want you to understand that I
ever spoke it. I always spoke English when I was talking with cats. They all
understand English as well as you do. They pick it up just as a child picks up
a language from hearing it spoken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forty years ago I was a young man, and, like most young men, I fancied that I
was in love with a young woman of our town. There isn&#8217;t the least doubt in my
mind that I should have married her if I had not known the cat language. She
afterwards married a man whom she took away to Africa with her as a
missionary. I knew him well, and he didn&#8217;t want to go to Africa. Said he had
no call to be a missionary, and that all he wanted was to live in a Christian
country where he could go and talk with the boys in the bar-room evenings. But
his wife carried him off, and it&#8217;s my belief that if I had married her she
would have made me turn missionary, or pirate, or anything else that she
thought best. I shall never cease to be grateful to Thomas Aquinas for saving
me from that woman.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 293]</span></p>

<span class="caption">&quot;i had an old negro housekeeper and two cats.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;This was the way of it. I was living in a little cottage that belonged to my
uncle, and that he let me have rent free on condition that I should take care
of it, and keep the grounds in an attractive state until he could sell it. I
had an old negro housekeeper and two cats. One of them, Martha Washington by
name, was young and handsome, and about as bright a cat as I ever knew. She
had a strong sense of humour, too, which is unusual with cats, and when
something amused her she would throw back her head and open her mouth wide,
and laugh a silent laugh that was as hearty and rollicking as a Methodist
parson&#8217;s laugh when he hears a grey-haired joke at a negro minstrel show.
Martha was perhaps the most popular cat in the town, and there was scarcely a
minute in the day when there wasn&#8217;t some one of her admirers in the back yard.
As for serenades, she had three or four every night that it didn&#8217;t rain. There
was a quartette club formed by four first-class feline voices, and the club
used to give Martha and me two or three hours of music three times a week. I
used sometimes to find as many as six or seven old boots in the back yard of a
morning that had been contributed by enthusiastic neighbours. As for society,
Martha Washington was at the top of the heap. There wasn&#8217;t a more fashionable
cat in the whole State of Ohio&mdash;I was living in Ohio at the time&mdash;and in spite
of it all she was as simple and unaffected in her ways as if she had been born
and bred in a Quaker meeting-house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One afternoon Martha was giving a four o&#8217;clock milk on the verandah next to
my room. I always gave her permission to<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 294]</span> give that sort of entertainment
whenever she wanted to, for the gossip of her friends used to be very amusing
to me. Among the guests that afternoon was Susan&#8217;s&mdash;that was the young lady I
wanted to marry&mdash;Maltese cat. Now this cat had always pretended to be very
fond of me, and Susan often said that her cat never made a mistake in reading
character, and that the cat&#8217;s approval of me was equivalent to a first-class
Sunday-school certificate of moral character. I didn&#8217;t care anything about the
cat myself, for somehow I didn&#8217;t place any confidence in her professions.
There was an expression about her tail which, to my mind, meant that she was
insincere and treacherous. The Maltese cat had finished her milk when the
conversation drifted around to the various mistresses of the cats, and
presently someone spoke of Susan. Then the Maltese began to say things about
Susan that made my blood boil. It was not only what she said but what she
insinuated, and, according to her, Susan was one of the meanest and most
contemptible women in the whole United States. I stood it as long as I could,
and then I got up and said to Martha Washington, &lsquo;I think your Maltese friend
is needed at her home, and the sooner she goes the better if she doesn&#8217;t want
to be helped home with a club.&rsquo; That was enough. The Maltese, who was doing up
her back fur when I spoke, stopped, looked at me as if she could tear me into
pieces, and then flounced out of the house without saying a word. I understood
that there was an end to her pretence of friendship for me, and that
henceforth I should have an enemy in Susan&#8217;s house who might, perhaps, be able
to do me a good deal of harm.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;the sooner she goes<br /> the better.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 295]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The next time I called to see Susan the Maltese was in the room, and she
instantly put up her back and tail and swore at me as if I was a Chinaman on
the look out for material for a stolen dinner. &lsquo;What can be the matter with
poor pussy?&rsquo; said Susan. &lsquo;She seems to be so terribly afraid of you all of a
sudden. I hope it doesn&#8217;t mean that you have been doing something that she
doesn&#8217;t approve of.&rsquo; I didn&#8217;t make any reply to this insinuation, except to
say that the cat might perhaps be going mad, but this didn&#8217;t help me any with
Susan, who was really angry at the idea that her cat could be capable of going
mad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The same sort of thing happened every time I went to the house. The cat was
always in the room, and always expressed in the plainest way the opinion that
I was a thief and a murderer, and an enemy of the temperance society. When I
asked her what she meant to do, she would give me no reply except a fresh
oath, or other bad language. Threats had no effect on her, for she knew that I
could not touch her in Susan&#8217;s house, and she didn&#8217;t intend that I should
catch her outside of the house. Nothing was clearer than that the Maltese was
bound to make a quarrel between me and Susan in revenge for what I had said at
Martha&#8217;s four o&#8217;clock milk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile Susan began to take the thing very seriously, and hinted that the
cat&#8217;s opposition to me might be a providential warning against me. &lsquo;I never
knew her to take such a prejudice against anyone before,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;except
against that converted Jew who afterwards turned out to be a burglar, and
nearly murdered poor dear Mr. Higby, the Baptist preacher, the night he broke
into Mr. Higby&#8217;s house and stole all his hams.&rsquo; Once when I did manage to give
the Maltese a surreptitious kick, and she yelled as if she was half-killed,
Susan said, &lsquo;I am really afraid<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 296]</span> I shall have to ask you to leave us now. Poor
pussy&#8217;s nerves are so thoroughly upset that I must devote all my energies to
soothing her. I do hope she is mistaken in her estimate of you.&rsquo; This was not
very encouraging, and I saw clearly that if the Maltese kept up her opposition
the chances that Susan would marry me were not worth a rush.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 382px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;poor pussy&#39;s nerves are<br /> thoroughly upset.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Did I tell you that I had a large grey cat by the name of Thomas Aquinas? He
was in some respects the most remarkable cat I ever met. Most people
considered him rather a dull person, but among cats he was conceded to have a
colossal mind. Cats would come from miles away to ask his advice about things.
I don&#8217;t mean such trifling matters as his views on mice-catching&mdash;which, by
the way, is a thing that has very little interest for most cats&mdash;or his
opinion of the best way in which to get a canary bird through the bars of a
cage. They used to consult him on matters of the highest importance, and the
opinions that he used to give would have laid over those of Benjamin Franklin
himself. Why Martha Washington told me that Thomas Aquinas knew more about
bringing up kittens than the oldest and most experienced feline matron that
she had ever known. As for common sense, Thomas Aquinas was just a solid chunk
of it, as you might say, and I got into the habit of consulting him whenever I
wanted a good, safe, cautious opinion. He would see at a glance where the
trouble was, and would give me advice that no lawyer could have beaten, no
matter how big a fee he might have charged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! I went home from Susan&#8217;s house, and I said to Thomas Aquinas, &lsquo;Thomas,&rsquo;
for he was one of those cats that you would no more have called &lsquo;Tom&rsquo; than you
would call Mr. Gladstone &lsquo;Bill&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Thomas,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I want you to come with me
to Miss Susan&#8217;s and tell that Maltese beast that if she doesn&#8217;t quit her
practice of swearing at me whenever I come into the room it will be the worse
for her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&#8217;s easy enough,&rsquo; said Thomas. &lsquo;I know one or two little things about
that cat that would not do to be told, and she knows that I know them. Never
you fear but that I can shut her up in a moment. I heard that she was going
about bragging that she would get square with you for something you said to
her one day, but I didn&#8217;t feel called upon to interfere without your express
approval.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 330px;">
<img src="images/img298.jpg" width="330" height="400" alt="&quot;susan came into the room.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;susan came into the room.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;The next day Thomas and I strolled over to Susan&#8217;s, and, as luck would have
it, we were shown into her reception room before she came down stairs. The
Maltese cat was in the room, and<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 297]</span> began her usual game of being filled with
horror at the sight of such a hardened wretch as myself. Of course, Thomas
Aquinas took it up at once, and the two had a pretty hot argument. Now Thomas,
in spite of his colossal mind, was a quick-tempered cat, and he was remarkably
free spoken when he was roused. One word led to another, and presently the
Maltese flew at Thomas, and for about two minutes that room was so thick with
fur that you could hardly see the fight. Of course, there could have been only
one end to the affair. My cat weighed twice what the Maltese weighed, and
after a few rounds he had her by the neck, and never let go until he had
killed her. I was just saying &lsquo;Hooray! Thomas!&rsquo; when Susan came into the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pass over what she said. Its general sense was that a man who encouraged
dumb animals to fight, and who brought a great savage brute into her house to
kill her sweet little pussy in her own parlour, wasn&#8217;t fit to live. She would
listen to no explanations, and when I said that Thomas had called at my
request to reason with the Maltese about her unkind conduct towards me, Susan
said that my attempt to turn an infamous outrage into a stupid joke made the
matter all the worse, and that she must insist that I and my prize fighting
beast should leave her house at once and never enter it again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you see that if it had not been that I understood what the Maltese cat
said at Martha Washington&#8217;s milk party, I should probably never have
quarrelled with either Susan or her cat, and should now have been a missionary
in Central Africa, if I hadn&#8217;t blown my brains out, or taken to drink. I have
often thought that the man Susan did marry might have been saved if he had
known the cat language in time, and had made the acquaintance of the
Maltese.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 298]</span></p>

<p>The Colonel paused, and presently I asked him if he really expected us to
believe his story. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;It isn&#8217;t any stiffer than Darwin&#8217;s
yarn about our being descended from monkeys. You believe that on the word of a
man you never saw, and I expect you to believe my story that I understand the
cat language on my unsupported word. Perhaps the story is a little tough, but
if you are going in for science you shouldn&#8217;t let your credulity be backed
down by any story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every one who writes an article upon Mr. Toole begins by telling his readers
how entirely lovable a man he is, and I do not know why I should differ from
every one else, for, in this case at all events, what every one says is true.
There are few actors, either in the past or present, who have so thoroughly
succeeded in placing themselves upon a footing of the most friendly and
cordial nature with their audience as Mr. John Lawrence Toole. And not only
has he succeeded in establishing such relations between himself and his
audience, but he has been to the full as successful in endowing the characters
he has undertaken with those same lovable qualities which have endeared him
both to the public and to his own private friends. Few actors so entirely
breathe into their parts the very spirit of their nature and essence of their
being as Mr. Toole breathes into his. With high and low, rich and old, young
and poor alike, he is a never-failing favourite, and the moment his kindly
face appears upon the stage, and the familiar voice once again awakens the
memories of bygone years, a burst of affectionate applause breaks out in
welcome of the dear old favourite of our English stage. No matter where a man
has been; in the Great Republic over the water, or in the burning lands of
India, or in the New World under our feet; when he returns, after years of
absence, to the old country, and the familiar faces have passed away, and all
things have become new, yet there is still one face that is the same, one
voice in which<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 301]</span> there is still the old familiar ring, and to many such a
wanderer old &ldquo;Johnny Toole&rdquo; becomes the one connecting line between the dear
old past and the cold new present. And who does not know the aspect of the man
himself&mdash;the short, sturdy figure, the slight limp in his walk, the kind,
pleasant face with the mobile mouth and the eyeglass screwed in the smiling
eye, and the hair, now sprinkled with grey, brushed back from the broad open
forehead? The genial, pleasant manner, the entire ease of the man, and the
utter absence of all that detestable putting on of &ldquo;side&rdquo; which is too often
characteristic of the young actor of the present day, how all these things go
towards the explanation of his universal popularity!</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">

</div>

<p>A great sorrow has overshadowed the latter years of his life, a sorrow
from which he will never shake himself free, but which has only deepened
the tenderness of the nature which is so characteristic of the man. I
spent a morning with him very recently in his house at Maida Vale. As he
entered the room and I asked him how he was, he replied, &ldquo;Oh, well, I am
pretty middling, thanks; an actor&#8217;s is such a hard life, you know,&rdquo; he
went on, confidentially, as he pushed me into a chair and took one
himself upon the opposite side of the hearthrug. &ldquo;I have just been
reading a whole bundle<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 302]</span> of manuscript plays, and you never saw such
rubbish in your life.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 599px;">
<img src="images/img303.jpg" width="599" height="600" alt="&quot;i can&#39;t lay my hands on &#39;em.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;i can&#39;t lay my hands on &#39;em.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>And then&rdquo;&mdash;he went on, plaintively enough&mdash;&ldquo;I lose the
things, you know; put &#8217;em into a drawer, or with a lot of other manuscripts
and papers, and I can&#8217;t lay my hands on &#8217;em when they are sent for, and then,
oh, goodness! there&#8217;s the deuce and all to pay; for I can assure you that no
mother thinks more of her first-born baby than a young author thinks of his
first play, and if you are not of the same opinion he regards you as the
biggest idiot in the world.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, but,&rdquo; I ventured to remark&mdash;&ldquo;why on earth
do you bother about the things?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said he&mdash;&ldquo;you know I can&#8217;t help
myself; you never can get away from them. For instance, I go out to a harmless
evening party, and a country parson comes up to me, the most unlikely man in
all the world, you&#8217;d think, and he&#8217;ll say to me, &lsquo;My brother has just written
a play, Mr. Toole; I wish you&#8217;d just cast your eye over it.&rsquo; And I can&#8217;t say
No, Mr. Blathwayt, I can&#8217;t say No. Well, now you&#8217;re here,&rdquo; he went on after a
moment, &ldquo;you&#8217;ll like to have a look round, won&#8217;t you? I&#8217;ve got lots of
interesting things here. Come into what I call my study&mdash;although,&rdquo; continued
he, with a laugh, &ldquo;I am afraid I don&#8217;t get through much study. I am too busy
to write, you know,&rdquo; he rambled on in a voice and manner that was amusingly<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 303]</span>
reminiscent of &ldquo;Walker London.&rdquo; So into the study we went, encountering on our
way a big Australian black bird, which was wandering about the house in an
aimless and irresponsible fashion, crooning to itself memories of its
Antipodean home. Before we entered the study, Mr. Toole drew my attention to a
beautiful model of the picturesque old Maypole Inn in &ldquo;Barnaby Rudge,&rdquo; with a
number of the characters in the novel wandering about in front of the house.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 323px;">

<span class="caption">mr. j. l. toole.</span>
</div>

<p>There was Barnaby Rudge himself, there was his supernaturally wicked old
raven; old Joe Willet, the landlord, stood smoking in his shirt-sleeves, while
pretty Dolly Varden herself was tripping down to town. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said my host,
&ldquo;isn&#8217;t that clever? It stood for many years at the &lsquo;Hen and Chickens&rsquo; in
Birmingham, and Dickens used to admire it very much when he used to visit that
town on his reading tours.&rdquo; Two little Japanese figures, reposing upon the top
of the case which contained this model, looked down upon Mr. Toole as he stood
beneath them. He set their arms and heads moving, observing, as he did so,
&ldquo;Often, when I am studying a part, I set those little figures going, they do
for the public applauding.&rdquo; In the study itself, the walls were thickly hung
with pictorial reminiscences&mdash;chiefly of the theatrical past. There were
portraits of Macready in character, with his small, neat writing beneath;
there was Charles Matthews in some character as a boy, and a portrait of old
John Reeve, a celebrated comedian in his day; there was Mr. Toole as <em>Paw
Clawdian</em>; there was Liston as <em>Paul Pry</em>; there were any amount of portraits
of his dear old friend Henry Irving. I was much interested in an old
theatrical bill of 1813 announcing Edmund Kean&#8217;s appearance as <em>Hamlet</em>. And
then Mr. Toole brought in a large framed letter which hung up in the hall. It
was a letter<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 304]</span> from Thackeray to Charles Matthews when he was lessee of Covent
Garden Theatre, and it was written on the occasion of the Queen&#8217;s first state
visit to Covent Garden after her marriage in 1840.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 321px;">
<img src="images/img306.jpg" width="321" height="400" alt="the hall." title="" />
<span class="caption">the hall.</span>
</div>

<p>A pen and ink sketch by Thackeray adorned a large half of the page, in
which he had represented Her Majesty with an enormous crown upon her
head, and two or three queer sceptres in her hand, talking to the Prince
Consort, who sat with her in the royal box, in the rear of which stood
the members of the royal suite. In another corner of the hall there hung
a letter,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 305]</span> carefully framed, which bore the signature of &ldquo;Nelson and
Bront&euml;,&rdquo; and close beside it there was a clever pencil sketch by
George Cruikshank, representing a London &#8217;bus full of people of that
period, and with the price, one shilling, marked up in large figures
outside it&mdash;a curious glimpse of bygone days. In Mr. Toole&#8217;s dining
room we found that clever lady artist, Folkard, who some time ago
painted so faithful a likeness of old Mrs. Keeley, engaged in giving the
finishing touches to an equally admirable portrait of my genial host
himself.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 288px;">

<span class="caption">mr. toole in &quot;artful cards.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>The dining room, no less than the other room, was crammed with &ldquo;virtuous
and bigoted articles.&rdquo; There was some beautiful old china which had once
belonged to Charles Dickens, and some<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 306]</span> handsome ivory elephants which
Mr. Toole had brought with him from Columbo stood upon the sideboard. A
very lovely oil painting by Keeley Halswelle, not in the least in his
usual style, represented a far stretch of country, over the blue sky of
which vast cumuli were massing themselves in snowy piles. There was a
portrait, by Clint, of Stephen Kemble, who, like Mark Lemon, used to
play <em>Falstaff</em> without padding. A painting of Joseph Jefferson, the
celebrated American Rip Van Winkle, reminded me of a splendid picture of
his which I always used to admire so much in the &ldquo;Players&#8217; Club&rdquo; in New
York, and I observed, as Mr. Toole pointed out a clever sketch by Mr.
Weedon Grossmith, that it was curious to notice how many actors were
also good painters. &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; replied Toole with a quizzical smile, &ldquo;I
have painted a good many years myself.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, indeed,&rdquo; said I&mdash;not
immediately catching his meaning&mdash;&ldquo;may I ask what you have
painted?&rdquo; &ldquo;My face,&rdquo; said he, with an amused chuckle of much enjoyment
at having caught me.</p>

<span class="caption">mr. toole in &quot;off the line.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Mr. Toole then pointed out to me James Wallack, the father of the
celebrated American actor, Lester Wallack, in his favourite character<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 307]</span>
of <em>The Brigand</em>. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mr. Toole, &ldquo;that reminds me of an anecdote
that&#8217;s told about James Wallack, and which ought to be a warning to
actors never to make speeches from the stage. Wallack was playing <em>The
Brigand</em> one night, and he was in the midst of his great dying scene,
when an old gentleman, who was sitting in the stalls, got up and put on
his hat, tied a scarf round his neck, and buttoned up his coat with
great deliberation. Wallack got very irritated, and just as the old
gentleman was going out, he called out to him, &lsquo;The piece is not
finished yet, sir.&rsquo; The old gentleman, who was not in the least
disconcerted, replied, &lsquo;Thank you, Mr. Wallack, I have seen <em>quite</em>
enough.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<span class="caption">mr. toole as &quot;the don.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>When we returned to the drawing room, into which I had first been shown,
having specially noted on my way through the hall Keeley Halswelle&#8217;s
sketch of Mr. Toole as <em>The Artful Dodger</em> in 1854, and a few pages from
Thackeray&#8217;s MSS. of &ldquo;Philip&rdquo; which hung upon the wall, Mr. Toole took
out an enormous photographic album which contained the portraits of all
the celebrities, big and little&mdash;and some of them were very big
indeed, and some of them were very small&mdash;who had been present at a
great banquet which was given in Mr. Toole&#8217;s honour before he left
England for his Australian tour. Everyone was<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 308]</span> there&mdash;noblemen,
journalists, and actors; legal luminaries and ecclesiastical
dignitaries, people of social prominence and scientific fame; all the
principal figures, indeed, that go to the making of this vast body
politic. &ldquo;I told a gentleman on board ship,&rdquo; humorously remarked Mr.
Toole, &ldquo;that these were all the members of my company. I don&#8217;t know if
he believed me or not.&rdquo; Then came albums full of autographs, old
playbills, portraits of celebrated actors long since crumbled into the
dust, letters the writing of which was fast fading away, a
characteristic letter from Charles Dickens acknowledging a beautiful
paper knife which Toole had sent him.</p>

<p>One of the letters which Mr. Toole most prizes, and the prayer of which, with
Mr. Hollingshead&#8217;s assistance, he was delighted to grant, is the following
characteristic epistle:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span style="margin-left: 22em;">&ldquo;Belle Vue Mansions, Brighton, August 6th, 1873.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Toole,&mdash;Were you ever in a mess? If you never were I can
explain it to you, having been in several; indeed, I don&#8217;t mind
confessing to you that I am in one now, and, strange to say, you are
perhaps the only man who can get me out of it. You need not button
up your pockets, it isn&#8217;t a pecuniary one. Only fancy! after thirty
years&#8217; practice and experience I have made a mistake in my dates,
and for the first time in my life find myself engaged to two
managers at the same time. Now, they say a man cannot serve two
masters, but I <span class="smcap">can</span> if they will come one after the other, only one
at a time, one down, t&#8217;other come on; but to play at Bristol and the
Gaiety on the same night (and keep it up for a week) I don&#8217;t see my
way to accomplish. In a moment of enthusiasm I engaged to begin with
Chute on September 29th, and I had scarcely done so when
Hollingshead reminded me that I was booked to begin with him on that
date, and that it could not be altered. Conceive my dismay. Chute
holds fast&mdash;&lsquo;can&#8217;t be altered.&rsquo; So does Hollingshead&mdash;&lsquo;can&#8217;t be
altered.&rsquo; Now, Toole&mdash;<em>dear</em> Toole, <span class="smcap">beloved</span> Toole&mdash;can&#8217;t you stay a
week longer at the Gaiety? <span class="smcap">Can&#8217;t</span> you let me begin there on Monday,
October 6th (as I thought I did), and get me out of my dilemma?
Can&#8217;t you make this sacrifice to friendship, and put three or four
hundred more into your pocket? Virtue is not its own reward, but an
extra week of fine business is. Now, Toole&mdash;adored Tooley&mdash;the best
of men&mdash;first of comedians&mdash;most amiable of your sex&mdash;burst into
tears&mdash;throw your arms and sob out, &lsquo;Do with me as thou wilt&mdash;play
me another week&mdash;pay me another three hundred, and be happy.&rsquo;
Breathless with anxiety, yet swelling with hope, I must await your
answer. Pity the sorrows of a poor old man, and even telegraph
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; rather than keep me in suspense. What&#8217;s a week to an
able-bodied low comedian? Child&#8217;s play! Why, you&#8217;ll be wanting to
throw in morning performances as well to keep you from rusting. It
really is a <em>chance</em> for you. Avail yourself of it and bless me, and
I&#8217;ll bless <em>you</em>, and Hollingshead will bless us both, and Chute
will bless us all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With my intermediate blessing, ever faithfully yours,</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 22em;">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">C. J. Matthews.</span>&rdquo;</span></p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 309]</span></p>

</div>

<p>This letter Mr. Toole read to me, exactly mimicking the tone and manner of his
old friend whom he still misses. I laughed heartily. &ldquo;Well, now, Mr. Toole,&rdquo;
said I, as we settled down for a conversation on the art he loves so well and
has served so faithfully, &ldquo;has the public taste altered much since you first
started in your theatrical career?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;upon my word I don&#8217;t
think it has very much. My dear old friend Irving, however, has effected as
great a change as any man, and his influence has always been for good.&rdquo; &ldquo;And
what of the other Henry?&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;Hendrik Ibsen?&rdquo; &ldquo;Henry <em>Gibson</em>?&rdquo; said
Toole, looking up; &ldquo;why, I never heard of him.&rdquo; &ldquo;No! <em>Ibsen</em>,&rdquo; I explained,
&ldquo;<em>Ibsen</em>,&rdquo; smiling as I mentally contrasted the great Norwegian physiologist
and social Reformer, and the simple-minded, homely, old-fashioned Englishman
whom we all love so well. &ldquo;Oh! Ibsen, Ibsen,&rdquo; said Mr. Toole, &ldquo;I didn&#8217;t catch
what you said; I thought you said Gibson, and I couldn&#8217;t think who on earth
you meant. Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&#8217;t like his work myself. It&#8217;s so unwholesome,
you know. It seems to me such a vitiated taste. They put it down to my
ignorance; but if you ask me what I think,&rdquo; he went on confidentially, &ldquo;I
should say there are very few who really care about him. He happens to be the
fashion just at present. I played <em>Ibsen</em> in &lsquo;Ibsen&#8217;s Ghost,&rsquo;&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;and they said it was a beautiful make-up. I don&#8217;t know what the old gentleman
would have thought of it himself. Have you seen Irving&#8217;s <em>Lear</em>?&rdquo; he suddenly
remarked, after a moment of silence. &ldquo;I can remember many <em>Lears</em>, but I have
never seen anything like his. I have been tremendously<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 310]</span> moved by it; but it is
far too great a strain for him.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="caption">toole and ibsen.</span>
</div>

<p>Mr. Toole then drifted into eulogy of his almost life-long friend, upon
whose generosity and the beauty of whose character he never wearies of
expatiating. &ldquo;And how do you think the comedy of to-day compares with
that of past years, Mr. Toole?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;I don&#8217;t
think things have altered much. It is true that there was a great gap
when Keeley, Buxton, Benjamin Webster, Sothern, and Charles Matthews all
passed away within a few years of each other. But we&#8217;ve lots of good
comedians now, to say nothing of the vast increase in the number of
theatres, which, of course, gives far more opportunities to new men than
was the case in my early days. For my own part, though I almost
invariably play low comedy parts, yet, as a rule, I prefer pathos, I
think.&rdquo; And, as he spoke, Mr. Toole handed me a photograph which
represented him in that very pathetic character <em>Caleb Plummer</em> in &ldquo;Dot.&rdquo;
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that&#8217;s one of my favourite characters, but people
come to see me for fun, they don&#8217;t look much for pathos in me, except,
perhaps, in the provinces. Ah! I like the provinces,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I
have many friends in them. The Scotch are a splendid people to play to,
but then English people, by which I mean English and Scotch alike, are
very clannish, and very tender to an old friend. I always feel when I
appear upon the stage<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 311]</span> that I am in the presence of friends.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 292px;">

</div>

<p>I don&#8217;t think that French actors are so much regarded as English actors.
We feel the affection of our people so much. But, then, we go in and out
as private friends amongst the people, more than the Frenchmen do. Their
best actors go out to a party, and they act for money, just as they
would in the theatre. I think that is very <em>infra dig.</em> myself. It seems
to me that as soon as the curtain is down the actor&#8217;s work is over for
the night, and when you go out to a man&#8217;s party you are his guest, but
you cease to be so if you take his money. With singers, however, the
case is quite different. Some say I am over fastidious, but, mind you,&rdquo;
went on Mr. Toole, very earnestly, &ldquo;I think it would be very snobbish
not to join in the fun that is going on as a friend, and help to make
everything go pleasantly. As a rule, however, I consider that on this
account the English actor&#8217;s social position is higher than that of a
French actor. You ask me about criticism,&rdquo; said Mr. Toole a little
later, as we wandered on through different fields of thought, over our
wine and cigars. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;it is very difficult to say
whether it has improved or not during late years. In the old days, you
know, we had some very good men; there was Oxenford, there was Bayle
Bernard, there was Laman Blanchard, all very good men indeed. In the
present day, Clement Scott is exceedingly clever, of course; but some of
the young men are too much up in the clouds for me&mdash;they are very
smart, I daresay, but I don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re driving at, you know;
all the same, I don&#8217;t think criticism has any more influence than it had
of old, in some cases not so much.&rdquo; And then, branching off on another
line, Mr. Toole said&mdash;&ldquo;Did you notice those remarks in the paper
the other day about Fanny Kemble&#8217;s father, and how he came to grief as a
theatrical manager? I smiled when I read them. I knew well enough how it
was; it<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 312]</span> was that infamous &lsquo;order&rsquo; system. Kemble actually gave 11,000
orders in one season. It&#8217;s altogether a rotten, bad system. Hundreds
apply to me every week for orders who haven&#8217;t the slightest claim upon
me, and especially wealthy people, who are invariably the greatest
offenders in this respect, and yet, when they are refused orders, they
at once book seats for the play.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/img313.jpg" width="500" height="405" alt="the library." title="" />
<span class="caption">the library.</span>
</div>

<p>Of course there are certain people who are thoroughly entitled to
orders, and I am only too glad to give them in such cases, but I draw
the line at giving them to <em>any</em> one who chooses to ask me. <em>I</em> can&#8217;t go
into a restaurant and get a dinner for nothing&mdash;I wish I could; a
tailor won&#8217;t make me a coat for nothing&mdash;why should I play to
people for nothing? They cannot have any idea how much it costs to keep
up a theatre, or perhaps they&#8217;d have a little more consideration for
one. It&#8217;s a rotten, bad system, and it ought to be done away with.&rdquo;
Later on in the evening Mr. Toole and I drove down to the theatre
together, and we resumed our conversation in his very interesting little
dressing-room. I congratulated him on the long run<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 313]</span> which &ldquo;Walker
London&rdquo; was having; &ldquo;but don&#8217;t long runs tend to artificiality?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>

<span class="caption">it&#39;s a rotten system.</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Toole; &ldquo;a new audience every evening saves you from that,
to a great extent, especially with an earnest man. Earnestness is
everything in an actor, but if you&#8217;re apathetic you&#8217;re lost. Still, I
sometimes look at <em>Paul Pry&#8217;s</em> umbrella,&rdquo; continued Mr. Toole, pointing to
the quaint, queer, green old article that answered to that description,
and which stood by itself in a corner of the room, &ldquo;and wish I could
play <em>Paul Pry</em> again, but I don&#8217;t see much chance of that at present.
Why, it will soon be &lsquo;Walker&#8217;s&rsquo; first birthday. I suppose they&#8217;ll want
me to make a speech. And speech-making always bothers me, for I am very
nervous.</p>

<p>But I daresay I shall &lsquo;gammon&rsquo; through somehow.&rdquo; I observed, &ldquo;Well, I
must say you &lsquo;gammon&rsquo; through very well, for I always think you are one
of the easiest speakers of the day.&rdquo; To which Mr. Toole replied, &ldquo;Well,
for my part, I think repose is everything. Quiet humour is always much
more telling than noisy<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 314]</span> fun, and to feel your part deeply is far more
than mere elocution.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you think that the training that young people
on the stage get, now-a-days, is as thorough as it was in your early
days, Mr. Toole?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&#8217;t think that young actors get
so much practice as they did in the old days when Irving and I used to
be for years together on a stock company in Edinburgh. He and I and
Helen Faucit have played all the parts in Shakespeare together. But
travelling companies have altered all that now-a-days. Still I think I
must say that I&#8217;ve got a very fairly good <em>r&eacute;pertoire</em> for my
people. Did you ever hear<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 315]</span> how I took to the stage?&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I
used to be clerk in a wine merchant&#8217;s office, and I was also a member of
the City Histrionic Club.</p>

<p>Well, one night I went to the Pavilion; one of the actors who used to
give imitations of popular favourites didn&#8217;t turn up, and so I was
persuaded by a man, who knew that I had been in the habit of giving
imitations myself to our little club, to take his place. It was then
that I first tasted the sweets of an actor&#8217;s life. It was then I
resolved to quit the merchant&#8217;s desk for the stage. Do you see that
playbill?&rdquo; he continued, pointing up to an old time-stained paper which
hung upon the wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that&#8217;s the first time my name ever appeared on a
London playbill. I appeared on that occasion for &lsquo;one night only&rsquo; at the
Haymarket Theatre, where a benefit was being given for Mr. Fred Webster,
in July, 1852.&rdquo; I glanced round the little room, in which are gathered
so many memories of the picturesque past, and in which so many of the
best known men of the present day are so frequently to be found having a
chat with &ldquo;Dear Old Johnny Toole.&rdquo; There was an amusing photograph of
Toole up to his waist in a hot lake in New Zealand surrounded by a
number of Maoris. There was a portrait of himself in his first part in
&ldquo;My Friend the Major.&rdquo; Charles Matthews, in &ldquo;My Awful Dad,&rdquo; smiled
across the room at Paul Bedford and Toole, who were standing within a
picture frame together. There was a quaint old coloured print
representing Grimaldi&mdash;for whom Mr. Toole has a great admiration,
and whose snuff-box he regards as quite a treasure&mdash;in private
life, and in his clown&#8217;s costume. But to enumerate further the
interesting pictures that hang upon the walls of his little
dressing-room would be to far exceed my allotted space. I happened on
the following night to be delivering a lecture at the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 316]</span> Playgoers&#8217; Club
on the Church and Stage, and before I left I asked Mr. Toole his opinion
on the subject. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think that the Church and the Stage
have a great deal in common, and I think that they ought to be great
friends, but I don&#8217;t see that we need reforming any more than any other
branches of the community. For my own part, I have the greatest respect
for the clergy, and a great many friends amongst them, and I always go
to church when I can. I am very fond of going to Westminster Abbey. I
like the music; it&#8217;s so solemn, you know&mdash;it always stirs me. I was
very much amused at an incident which occurred to me the other day. I
was playing in York, so on Sunday I went to the Minster as usual; on the
following day, a man I knew came up to me and said, quite in good faith,
&lsquo;Why, I saw you in church yesterday, and you were behaving quite
quietly!&rsquo; Just as though he had expected me to go in costume, and behave
as though I were on the stage. But that is one of the ridiculous ideas
that people get into their heads about actors. Still, I think, all that
kind of thing is dying down now-a-days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How much more of our&mdash;fortunately not very valuable&mdash;time we devoted to this
wonderful novel of ours I cannot exactly say. Turning the dogs&#8217;-eared leaves
of the dilapidated diary that lies before me, I find the record of our later
gatherings confused and incomplete. For weeks there does not appear a single
word. Then comes an alarmingly business-like minute of a meeting at which
there were&mdash;&ldquo;Present: Jephson, MacShaugnassy, Brown, and Self&rdquo;; and at which
the &ldquo;Proceedings commenced at 8.30.&rdquo; At what time the &ldquo;proceedings&rdquo;
terminated, and what business was done, the chronicle, however, sayeth not;
though, faintly pencilled in the margin of the page, I trace these
hieroglyphics: &ldquo;3&middot;14&middot;9&mdash;2&middot;6&middot;7,&rdquo; bringing out a result of &ldquo;1&middot;8&middot;2.&rdquo; Evidently an
unremunerative night.</p>

<p>On September thirteenth, we seem to have become suddenly imbued with energy to
a quite remarkable degree, for I read that we &ldquo;Resolved to start the first
chapter at once&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;at once&rdquo; being underlined. After this spurt, we rest until
October fourth, when we &ldquo;Discussed whether it should be a novel of plot or of
character,&rdquo; without&mdash;so far as the diary affords indication&mdash;arriving at any
definite decision. I observe that on the same day, &ldquo;Mac told story about a man
who accidentally bought a camel at a sale.&rdquo; Details of the story are,
however, wanting, which, perhaps, is fortunate for the reader.</p>

<p>On the sixteenth, we were still debating the character of our hero; and I see
that I suggested &ldquo;a man of the Charley Buswell type.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Charley, I wonder what could have made me think of him in connection with
heroes; his lovableness, I suppose&mdash;certainly not his heroic qualities. I can
recall his boyish face now (it was always a boyish face), the tears streaming
down it as he sat in the schoolyard beside a bucket, in which he was drowning
three white mice and a tame rat. I sat down opposite and cried too, while
helping him to hold a saucepan lid over the poor little creatures, and thus
there sprang up a friendship between us, which grew.</p>

<p>Over the grave of these murdered rodents, he took a solemn oath never to break
school rules again, by keeping either white mice or tame rats, but to devote
the whole of his energies for the future to pleasing his masters, and
affording his parents some satisfaction for the money being spent upon his
education.</p>

<p>Seven weeks later, the pervadence throughout the dormitory of an atmospheric
effect more curious than pleasing led to the discovery that he had converted
his box into a rabbit hutch. Confronted with eleven kicking witnesses, and
reminded of his former promises, he explained that rabbits were not mice, and
seemed to consider that a new and vexatious regulation had been sprung upon
him. The rabbits were confiscated. What was their ultimate fate, we never knew
with certainty, but three days later we were given rabbit-pie for dinner. To
comfort him I endeavoured to assure him that these could not be his rabbits.
He, however, convinced that they were, cried steadily into his plate all the
time that he was eating them, and afterwards, in the playground, had a
stand-up fight with a fourth form boy who had requested a second helping.</p>

<p>That evening he performed another solemn oath-taking, and for the next month
was the model boy of the school. He read tracts, sent his spare pocket-money
to assist in annoying the heathen, and subscribed to &ldquo;The Young Christian&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Weekly Rambler, an Evangelical Miscellany&rdquo; (whatever that may mean). An
undiluted course of this pernicious literature naturally created in him a
desire towards the opposite extreme. He suddenly dropped &ldquo;The Young Christian&rdquo;
and &ldquo;The Weekly Rambler,&rdquo; and purchased penny dreadfuls; and, taking no
further interest in the welfare of the heathen, saved up and bought a<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 319]</span>
second-hand revolver and a hundred cartridges. His ambition, he confided to
me, was to become &ldquo;a dead shot,&rdquo; and the marvel of it is that he did not
succeed.</p></div></div>

<p>Of course, there followed the usual discovery and consequent trouble, the
usual repentance and reformation, the usual determination to start a new life.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 292px;">
<img src="images/img320.jpg" width="292" height="400" alt="&quot;a dead shot.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;a dead shot.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Poor fellow, he lived &ldquo;starting a new life.&rdquo; Every New Year&#8217;s Day he would
start a new life&mdash;on his birthday&mdash;on other people&#8217;s birthdays. I fancy that,
later on, when he came to know their importance, he extended the principle to
quarter days. &ldquo;Tidying up, and starting afresh,&rdquo; he always called it.</p>

<p>I think as a young man he was better than most of us. But he lacked that great
gift which is the distinguishing feature of the English-speaking race all the
world over, the gift of hypocrisy. He seemed incapable of doing the slightest
thing without getting found out; a grave misfortune for a man to suffer from,
this.</p>

<p>Dear simple-hearted fellow, it never occurred to him that he was as other
men&mdash;with, perhaps, a dash of straightforwardness added; he regarded himself
as a monster of depravity. One evening I found him in his chambers engaged
upon his Sisyphean labour of &ldquo;tidying up.&rdquo; A heap of letters, photographs, and
bills lay before him. He was tearing them up and throwing them into the fire.</p>

<p>I came towards him, but he stopped me. &ldquo;Don&#8217;t come near me,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;don&#8217;t
touch me. I&#8217;m not fit to shake hands with a decent man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the sort of speech to make one feel hot and uncomfortable. I did not
know what to answer, and murmured something about his being no worse than the
average.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t talk like that,&rdquo; he answered excitedly; &ldquo;you say that to comfort me, I
know; but I don&#8217;t like to hear it. If I thought other men were like me I
should be ashamed of being a man. I&#8217;ve been a blackguard, old fellow, but,
please God, it&#8217;s not too late. To-morrow morning I begin a new life.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 320]</span></p>

<p>He finished his work of destruction, and then rang the bell, and sent his man
downstairs for a bottle of champagne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My last drink,&rdquo; he said, as we clicked glasses. &ldquo;Here&#8217;s to the old life out,
and the new life in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took a sip and flung the glass with the remainder into the fire. He was
always a little theatrical, especially when most in earnest.</p>

<p>For a long while after that I saw nothing of him. Then, one evening, sitting
down to supper at a restaurant, I noticed him opposite to me in company that
could hardly be called doubtful.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/img321.jpg" width="500" height="324" alt="&quot;in company that could hardly be called doubtful.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;in company that could hardly<br /> be called doubtful.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>He flushed and came over to me. &ldquo;I&#8217;ve been an old woman for nearly six
months,&rdquo; he said, with a laugh. &ldquo;I find I can&#8217;t stand it any longer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;what is life for but to live? It&#8217;s only
hypocritical to try and be a thing we are not. And do you know&rdquo;&mdash;he leant
across the table, speaking earnestly&mdash;&ldquo;honestly and seriously, I&#8217;m a better
man&mdash;I feel it and know it&mdash;when I am my natural self than when I am trying to
be an impossible saint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was the mistake he made; he always ran to extremes. He thought that an
oath, if it were only big enough, would frighten away Human Nature, instead of
serving only as a challenge to it. Accordingly, each reformation was more
intemperate than the last, to be duly followed by a greater swing of the
pendulum in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Being now in a thoroughly reckless mood, he went the pace rather hotly. Then,
one evening, without any previous warning, I had a note from him. &ldquo;Come round
and see me on Thursday. It is my wedding eve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I went. He was once more &ldquo;tidying up.&rdquo; All his drawers were open, and on the
table were piled packs of cards, betting books, and much written paper, as
before, all in course of demolition.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 321]</span></p>

<p>I smiled; I could not help it, and, no way abashed, he laughed his usual
hearty, honest laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he exclaimed gaily, &ldquo;but this is not the same as the others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, laying his hand on my shoulder, and speaking with the sudden seriousness
that comes so readily to shallow natures, he said, &ldquo;God has heard my prayer,
old friend. He knows I am weak. He has sent down an angel out of heaven to
help me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took her portrait from the mantelpiece and handed it me. It seemed to me
the face of a hard, narrow woman, but, of course, he raved about her.</p>

<p>As he talked, there fluttered to the ground from the heap before him an old
restaurant bill, and, stooping, he picked it up and held it in his hand,
musing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you ever noticed how the scent of the champagne and the candles seems to
cling to these things?&rdquo; he said lightly, sniffing carelessly at it. &ldquo;I wonder
what&#8217;s become of her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I wouldn&#8217;t think about her at all to-night,&rdquo; I answered.</p>

<p>He loosened his hand, letting the paper fall into the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he cried, vehemently, &ldquo;when I think of all the wrong I have
done&mdash;the irreparable, ever-widening ruin I have perhaps brought into the
world&mdash;O God! spare me a long life that I may make amends. Every hour, every
minute of it shall be devoted to your service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he stood there, with his eager boyish eyes upraised, a light seemed to fall
upon his face and illumine it. I had pushed the photograph back to him, and it
lay upon the table before him. He knelt and pressed his lips to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With your help, my darling; and His,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>

<p>The next morning he was married. She was a well-meaning girl, though her
piety, as with most people, was of the negative order; and her antipathy to
things evil much stronger than her sympathy with things good. For a much
longer time than I had expected she kept him straight&mdash;perhaps, a little too
straight. But at last there came the inevitable relapse.</p>

<p>I called upon him, in answer to an excited message, and found him in the
depths of despair. It was the old story, human weakness, combined with
lamentable lack of the most ordinary precautions against being found out. He
gave me details, interspersed with exuberant denunciations of himself, and I
undertook the delicate task of peacemaker.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 322]</span></p>

<p>It was a weary work, but eventually she consented to forgive him. His joy,
when I told him, was boundless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How good women are,&rdquo; he said, while the tears came into his eyes. &ldquo;But she
shall not repent it. Please God, from this day forth, I&#8217;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped, and for the first time in his life the doubt of himself crossed
his mind. As I sat watching him, the joy died out of his face, and the first
hint of age passed over it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I seem to have been &lsquo;tidying up and starting afresh&rsquo; all my life,&rdquo; he said,
wearily; &ldquo;I&#8217;m beginning to see where the untidiness lies, and the only way to
get rid of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did not understand the meaning of his words at the time, but learnt it later
on.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/img323.jpg" width="500" height="270" alt="&quot;lying dead.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;lying dead.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>He strove according to his strength, and fell. By a miracle his transgression
was not discovered. The facts came to light long afterwards, but at the time
there were only two who knew.</p>

<p>It was his last failure. Late one evening I received a hurriedly scrawled note
from his wife begging me to come round.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A terrible thing has happened,&rdquo; it ran; &ldquo;Charley went up to his study after
dinner, saying he had some &lsquo;tidying up,&rsquo; as he calls it, to do, and did not
wish to be disturbed. In clearing out his desk he must have handled carelessly
the revolver that he always keeps there, not remembering, I suppose, that it
was loaded. We heard a report, and on rushing into the room found him lying
dead on the floor. The bullet had passed right through his heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hardly the type of man for a hero! And yet I do not know. Perhaps he fought
harder than many a man who conquers. In the world&#8217;s courts, we are compelled
to judge on circumstantial evidence only, and the chief witness, the man&#8217;s
soul, cannot very well be called.</p>

<p>I remember the subject of bravery being discussed one evening at a dinner
party, when a German gentleman present related an anecdote, the hero of which
was a young Prussian officer.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 323]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot give you his name,&rdquo; our German friend explained&mdash;&ldquo;the man himself
told me the story in confidence; and though he personally, by virtue of his
after record, could afford to have it known, there are other reasons why it
should not be bruited about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How I learnt it was in this way. For a dashing exploit performed during the
brief war against Austria he had been presented with the Iron Cross. This, as
you are well aware, is the most highly-prized decoration in the German Army;
men who have earned it are usually conceited about it, and, indeed, have some
excuse for being so. He, on the contrary, kept his locked in a drawer of his
desk, and never wore it except when compelled by official etiquette. The mere
sight of it seemed to be painful to him. One day I asked him the reason. We
are very old and close friends, and he told me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The incident occurred when he was a young lieutenant. Indeed, it was his
first engagement. By some means or another he had become separated from his
company, and, unable to regain it, had attached himself to a Landwehr regiment
stationed at the extreme right of the Prussian lines.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The enemy&#8217;s effort was mainly directed against the left centre, and for a
while our young lieutenant was nothing more than a distant spectator of the
battle. Suddenly, however, the attack shifted, and the regiment found itself
occupying an extremely important and critical position. The shells began to
fall unpleasantly near, and the order was given to &lsquo;grass.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The men fell upon their faces and waited. The shells ploughed the ground
around them, smothering them with dirt. A horrible, griping pain started in my
young friend&#8217;s stomach, and began creeping upwards. His head and heart both
seemed to be shrinking and growing cold. A shot tore off the head of the man
next to him, sending the blood spurting into his face; a minute later another
ripped open the back of a poor fellow lying to the front of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His body seemed not to belong to himself at all. A strange, shrivelled
creature seemed to have taken possession of it. He raised his head, and peered
about him. He and three soldiers&mdash;youngsters, like himself, who had never
before been under fire&mdash;appeared to be utterly alone in that hell. They were
the end men of the regiment, and the configuration of the ground completely
hid them from their comrades.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They glanced at each other, these four, and read each other&#8217;s<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 324]</span> thoughts in
each other&#8217;s eyes. Leaving their rifles lying on the grass, they commenced to
crawl stealthily upon their bellies, the lieutenant leading, the other three
following.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some few hundred yards in front of them rose a small, steep hill. If they
could reach this it would shut them out of sight. They hastened on, pausing
every thirty yards or so to lie still and pant for breath, then hurrying on
again, quicker than before, tearing their flesh against the broken ground.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 295px;">
<img src="images/img325.jpg" width="295" height="500" alt="&quot;commenced to crawl stealthily.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;commenced to crawl stealthily.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;At last they reached the base of the slope, and slinking a little way round
it, raised their heads and looked back. Where they were it was impossible for
them to be seen from the German lines.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They sprang to their feet and broke into a wild race. A dozen steps further
they came face to face with an Austrian field battery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The demon that had taken possession of them had been growing stronger and
stronger the further and further they had fled. They were not men, they were
animals mad with fear. Driven by the same frenzy that prompted other
panic-stricken creatures to once rush down a steep place into the sea, these
four men, with a yell, flung themselves, sword in hand, upon the whole
battery; and the whole battery, bewildered by the suddenness and
unexpectedness of the attack, thinking the entire battalion was upon them,
gave way, and rushed pell-mell down the hill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the sight of those flying Austrians the fear, as independently as it had
come to him, left him, and he felt only a desire to hack and kill. The four
Prussians flew after them, cutting and stabbing at them as they ran; and when
the Prussian cavalry came thundering up, they found my young lieutenant and
his three friends had captured two guns and accounted for half a score of the
enemy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next day, he was summoned to headquarters.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 325]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Will you be good enough to remember for the future, sir,&rsquo; said the Chief of
the Staff, &lsquo;that His Majesty does not require his lieutenants to execute
man&oelig;uvres on their own responsibility, and also that to attack a battery
with three men is not war, but damned tomfoolery. You ought to be
court-martialled, sir!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, in somewhat different tones, the old soldier added, his face softening
into a smile: &lsquo;However, alertness and daring, my young friend, are good
qualities, especially when crowned with success. If the Austrians had once
succeeded in planting a battery on that hill it might have been difficult to
dislodge them. Perhaps, under the circumstances, His Majesty may overlook your
indiscretion.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;His Majesty not only overlooked it, but bestowed upon me the Iron Cross,&rsquo;
concluded my friend. &lsquo;For the credit of the army, I judged it better to keep
quiet and take it. But, as you can understand, the sight of it does not recall
very pleasurable reflections.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>To return to my diary, I see that on November fourteenth we held another
meeting. But at this there were present only &ldquo;Jephson, MacShaugnassy, and
Self&rdquo;; and of Brown&#8217;s name I find henceforth no further trace. On Christmas
Eve we three met again, and my notes inform me that MacShaugnassy brewed some
whiskey-punch, according to a recipe of his own, a record suggestive of a sad
Christmas for all three of us. No particular business appears to have been
accomplished on either occasion.</p>

<p>Then there is a break until February eighth, and the assemblage has shrunk to
&ldquo;Jephson and Self.&rdquo; With a final flicker, as of a dying candle, my diary at
this point, however, grows luminous, shedding much light upon that evening&#8217;s
conversation.</p>

<p>Our talk seems to have been of many things&mdash;of most things, in fact, except
our novel. Among other subjects we spoke of literature generally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am tired of this eternal cackle about books,&rdquo; said Jephson; &ldquo;these columns
of criticism to every line of writing; these endless books about books; these
shrill praises and shrill denunciations; this silly worship of novelist Tom;
this silly hate of poet Dick; this silly squabbling over playwright Harry.
There is no soberness, no sense in it all. One would think, to listen to the
High Priests of Culture, that man was made for literature, not literature for
man. Thought existed before the Printing Press; and the men who wrote the best
hundred books never read them. Books have their place in the world, but they
are not its purpose. They are things<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 326]</span> side by side with beef and mutton, the
scent of the sea, the touch of a hand, the memory of a hope, and all the other
items in the sum total of our three-score years and ten. Yet we speak of them
as though they were the voice of life instead of merely its faint, distorted
echo. Tales are delightful <em>as</em> tales&mdash;sweet as primroses after the long
winter, restful as the cawing of rooks at sunset. But we do not write &lsquo;tales&rsquo;
now; we prepare &lsquo;human documents&rsquo; and dissect souls.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 303px;">
<img src="images/img327.jpg" width="303" height="400" alt="&quot;remember for the future, sir.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;remember for the<br /> future, sir.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>He broke off abruptly in the midst of his tirade. &ldquo;Do you know what these
&lsquo;psychological studies&rsquo; that are so fashionable just now always make me think
of?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;One monkey examining another monkey for fleas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what, after all, does our dissecting pen lay bare?&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Human
nature? or merely some more or less unsavoury undergarment, disguising and
disfiguring human nature? There is a story told of an elderly tramp, who,
overtaken by misfortune, was compelled to retire for a while to the seclusion
of Portland. His hosts, desiring to see as much as possible of their guest
during his limited stay with them, proceeded to bath him. They bathed him
twice a day for a week, each time learning more of him; until at last they
reached a flannel shirt. And with that they had to be content, soap and water
proving powerless to go further.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That tramp appears to me symbolical of mankind. Human Nature has worn its
conventions for so long that its habit has grown on to it. In this nineteenth
century it is impossible to say where the clothes of custom end and the man
begins. Our virtues are taught to us as a branch of &lsquo;Deportment&rsquo;; our vices
are the recognised vices of our reign and set. Our religion hangs ready made
beside our cradle to be buttoned upon us by loving hands. Our tastes we
acquire, with difficulty; our sentiments we learn by rote. At cost of infinite
suffering, we study to love whiskey and cigars, high art and classical music.
In one age we admire Byron and drink sweet champagne: twenty years later it is
more<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 327]</span> fashionable to prefer Shelley, and we like our champagne dry. At school
we are told that Shakespeare was a great poet, and that the Venus di Medici is
a fine piece of sculpture; and so for the rest of our lives we go about saying
what a great poet we think Shakespeare, and that there is no piece of
sculpture, in our opinion, so fine as the Venus di Medici. If we are Frenchmen
we adore our mother; if Englishmen we love dogs and virtue. We grieve for the
death of a near relative twelve months; but for a second cousin, we sorrow
only three. The good man has his regulation excellencies to strive after, his
regulation sins to repent of. I knew a good man who was quite troubled because
he was not proud, and could not, therefore, with any reasonableness, pray for
humility. In society one must needs be cynical and mildly wicked: in Bohemia
orthodoxly unorthodox. I remember my mother expostulating with a friend, an
actress, who had left a devoted husband and eloped with a disagreeable, ugly,
little low comedian (I am speaking of long, long ago).</p>

</div>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You must be mad,&rsquo; said my mother; &lsquo;what on earth induced you to take such a
step?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My dear Emma,&rsquo; replied the lady; &lsquo;what else was there for me? You know I
can&#8217;t act. I had to do <em>something</em> to show I was an artiste!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are dressed up marionnettes. Our voice is the voice of<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 328]</span> the unseen
showman, Convention; our very movements of passion and pain are but in answer
to his jerk. A man resembles one of those gigantic bundles that one sees in
nursemaids&#8217; arms. It is very bulky and very long; it looks a mass of delicate
lace and rich fur and fine woven stuffs; and somewhere, hidden out of sight
among the finery, there is a tiny red bit of bewildered humanity, with no
voice but a foolish cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is but one story,&rdquo; he went on, after a long pause, uttering his own
thoughts aloud rather than speaking to me. &ldquo;We sit at our desks and think and
think, and write and write, but the story is ever the same. Men told it and
men listened to it many years ago; we are telling it to one another to-day; we
shall be telling it to one another a thousand years hence; and the story is:
&lsquo;Once upon a time there lived a man and a woman who loved him.&rsquo; The little
critic cries that it is not new, and asks for something fresh, thinking&mdash;as
children do&mdash;that there are strange things in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that point, my notes end, and there is nothing in the book beyond. Whether
any of us thought any more of the novel, whether we ever met again to discuss
it, whether it were ever begun, whether it were ever abandoned&mdash;I cannot say.
There is a fairy story that I read many, many years ago that has never ceased
to haunt me. It told how a little boy once climbed a rainbow. And at the end
of the rainbow he came to the most wonderful land that was ever dreamt of. Its
houses were built of gold, and its streets were paved with silver. Its palaces
were so beautiful that no language could describe them, but to merely look at
them satisfied all yearnings. And all the men who dwelt in this city were
great and good; and the women fairer than the women of a boy&#8217;s dream. And the
name of the city was &ldquo;The city of things men meant to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And this is the end of it all!</p>

<p>The sharp queries and sullen answers, the sobs, tears, and bickerings are
over, and in their stead reigns the cold silence of resolution.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 288px;">
<img src="images/img330.jpg" width="288" height="400" alt="&quot;idly looking out of the window.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;idly looking out of<br /> the window.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>How did it all begin? Neither could tell. Yet the torture of an unworthy
suspicion, and a pride that scorns to answer the doubts of an exacting love,
have apparently sufficed to obliterate the memory of the happiness of three
unclouded years of kindness and love.</p>

<p>They are going to separate. There is nothing else to do, She says, and He
tacitly agrees, for he knows it is impossible to go on living in this
atmosphere of discontent. And they calmly arrange their affairs, as though it
were merely a question of a few weeks&#8217; absence, instead of the breaking up of
their home. He will travel, and She will stay on at their house a little
longer, till her mother goes abroad, when she will join her, dismissing all
the servants, excepting the old nurse who looks after their child. Ah! it is
the thought of their child that makes the separation so hard, and He feels
that the last link between them is broken, when he yields that little life
into the hands of the wife who does not trust him, thinking bitterly in his
heart that he may be taught to hate him.</p>

<p>She sits in the drawing-room, idly looking out of the window, surprised at the
dead calm that seems to have come over the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 330]</span> house. An organ is playing in the
street, and the notes jar on her strained nerves till she could scream; but
she sits still with her hands in her lap, trying to believe that she is
utterly indifferent to present, past, or future, yet unconsciously listening
to the hurried, heavy footsteps overhead, where her husband is packing his
portmanteau. She is quite anxious for a moment as she remembers she has put
away his fur-lined coat that might be useful if he goes travelling in chilly
regions, but she recollects herself with a start, and does not stir from her
seat. She lets the bitter thoughts come uppermost in her heart now, for she is
convinced, of course, that this parting is the best thing that could take
place. Upstairs, He, quite helpless as to the locality of many necessaries
that have hitherto been prepared for him by thoughtful hands, and not feeling
able to confront his servant&#8217;s inquiring eyes, is savagely thrusting linen
into an unwilling receptacle, whence ties and collars stick out provokingly at
odd corners, and trying to subdue a queer feeling that oppresses him when he
thinks of her stony indifference.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 299px;">
<img src="images/img331.jpg" width="299" height="500" alt="&quot;comes slowly down the stairs.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;comes slowly down<br /> the stairs.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>So the packing goes on, and the organ grinds merrily, and is inwardly but
emphatically cursed by at least two ungrateful people.</p>

<p>At last He is ready, and comes slowly down the stairs, giving some very
audible and offhand orders in the hall respecting his particular belongings. A
close observer might notice that he speaks and laughs a little too readily.
The little, pale woman, sitting motionless in the room, hears him, and in her
heart of hearts hears what he strives to hide.</p>

<p>After all, it is a great wrench for a man to leave his&mdash;well, then, whose
fault is it? And the old arguments and suspicions rise again in her mind and
deaden all other feelings.</p>

<p>He comes into the drawing-room, hat in hand, very firm and very calm. She does
not move.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 331]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he says, holding out his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; she answers, taking it mechanically.</p>

<p>He pauses at the door, and their eyes meet. &ldquo;It is much better so,&rdquo; she says,
faintly. And he is gone.</p>

<p>Then there is a rushing and singing in her ears. The notes of the organ rise
louder and louder, till they swell into a rich anthem&mdash;the garish daylight
changes to the dim light of a church&mdash;she walks up the aisle in a glistening
white dress, on which pearldrops shake and tremble. She hears a dim murmur of
voices and rustling of garments, and the scent of white flowers is heavy in
the air. There rises a clear voice, whose fervour moves her inmost heart,
exhorting her to love, honour and obey&mdash;and out of the fulness of her soul she
promises. <em>Oh! God, oh! God, she meant to keep that promise.</em></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 338px;">
<img src="images/img332.jpg" width="338" height="500" alt="&quot;a white, wild-looking face.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;a white, wild-looking face.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Then comes a confused din of voices and rolling of carriages, but she is only
conscious of the strong arm to which she clings, and the clear face that bends
so tenderly over hers.</p>

<p>With a little sobbing gasp she opens her eyes. Has she been asleep? No, but
the organ has stopped and is rumbling down the street, followed by a crowd of
small boys and girls, whose ears are not sensitive to the quality of music.</p>

<p>She rises. Her knees are shaking as she drags herself painfully across the
room, catching a glimpse of a white, wild-looking face in the tall pier-glass
as she clutches the handle of the door, and then the sight of the empty
hat-rack in the hall, the absence of coat and stick, or fragrant whiff of
cigar, bring the irrevocableness of the parting home to her more vividly than
anything&mdash;more than the few words of farewell, the cold handshake, and the
slam of the hall door half-an-hour ago. &ldquo;Was it only half-an-hour?&rdquo; she
murmurs, staring stupidly at the clock; &ldquo;it seems an eternity! And now he is
going farther and farther from me,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 332]</span> never to return&mdash;never to tease, and
praise and love me, for (she sobs) he did love me once, in spite of
everything&mdash;never to laugh at me and call me &lsquo;little woman&rsquo;&mdash;never to hold my
hand or ask my help again! He is thinking of his wasted life and love; yes, he
will believe he has wasted it on <em>me</em>. He is thinking of our little child&mdash;he
did not bid him good-bye&mdash;how could he bear to?&rdquo; Ah! there is still something
left for her to love; but what is left for him? And with bitter tears she
remembers how quietly he gave the child up to her, and how she accepted the
sacrifice as a matter of course, though she knew what it cost him.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 443px;">
<img src="images/img333.jpg" width="443" height="500" alt="&quot;the nursery is empty.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;the nursery is empty.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>With beating heart she goes upstairs. The cosy, pretty nursery is empty. The
nurse has taken the child to Kensington Gardens as usual. She passes on into
their bedroom. It is still in disorder, and she has not the heart to put it
straight, though she feels that a little occupation would do her good. The sun
shines warmly into the room, but she shivers.</p>

<p>There is nothing but loneliness in the house, and that she cannot bear, for it
brings thoughts, and she dares not think.</p>

<p>Hardly knowing what she does, she finds and puts on her hat and gloves, and
turns to go, but, at the very threshold, she stumbles over something&mdash;why, it
is the little silver match-box he always uses&mdash;and loses. She must take it to
him&mdash;then she remembers, and, oh! strange woman, covers it with tears and
kisses. She hurries down the stairs, and out of the house, and a<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 333]</span> long way
down the street before she knows that she is hurrying, because she cannot bear
to be alone. An awful feeling of restlessness, of reproach, will not let her
be still, and yet she was so calm a little while ago.</p>

<p>On&mdash;on&mdash;regardless of curious looks, for her cheeks are tear-stained, and now
and then there is a little catch in her breath, that she cannot repress.</p>

<p>On&mdash;past the quaint old red brick palace, whose history they read together,
past the pond with its toy navy and anxious captains, past nursemaids,
children, and mooning philosophers she hurries, feverishly longing to reach
the chosen nook where a joyous welcome awaits her.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;the pond and its toy navy.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Now she is near&mdash;but the seat is empty, and the nurse is gossiping in the
distance. She runs on angrily&mdash;and stops! For, under a sheltering tree, He
stands bidding their little child good-bye. She can hear his gentle words, and
the soft, cooing answers, and she dumbly stretches out her arms, as a great
wave of love surges in her heart and drowns the bitter thoughts for ever. In a
little while he will go, and then this tide of love and repentance will have
come too late.</p>

<p>She calls him faintly&mdash;and he turns. Her hat is awry, her hair coming down,
and she has torn her pretty dress on some projecting<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 334]</span> branch, yet He thinks
she never looked more beautiful, as he answers the mute appeal of those
tearful eyes, and takes her in his arms. Deep silence reigns. Then, from the
depths of a penitent heart, she sobs out loving, passionate words: &ldquo;Forgive
me&mdash;my husband!&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 335]</span></p>

<p>ome West Indian insects have an almost human strength of purpose. For three
consecutive nights I suffered from a sort of vampire cockroach, who crept
under my pyjamas whilst I slept, and nibbled my chest. When I awoke, I could
feel him hurrying off by way of my arm or leg. The moment worn-out nature
reasserted itself in me, and I dozed again, that ghoul of a cockroach came
back and proceeded with its fell banquet. At length, weakened no doubt by loss
of blood and frantic with the thought that a mere piece of determined vermin
should thus habitually sup off me, I rose in the dead of a moonless night,
turned on the electric light, selected a handy shoe, and then started to have
it out, once for all, with that man-eating cockroach. He broke cover from
under some curiosities, and went away at a killing pace. But I had stopped his
&ldquo;earths&rdquo; all round the cabin, and after a ten minutes&#8217; burst in the open, he
settled down, evidently feeling that I meant business. Though not his equal in
pace, I hoped to find myself a better stayer. He caught my eye once, when he
was jumping over my sponge with a view to getting into some very difficult
country under my bunk. The expression in it evidently alarmed him, and he
redoubled his efforts. Twice I had made play with the shoe. Once I nearly
landed him upon the side of his head; the other time I broke a rather valuable
curiosity. Finally, the cockroach began to fly; then, for a while, he had
matters his own way. I struck out to the right and left with a view to winging
him, but he certainly showed great ability in the air, and dodged under the
shoe and over it, and then hit me in the face, and was out again before I
could get a blow back. Now, from being a sort of fox-hunt, the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 336]</span> affair had
degenerated into a prize-fight; and it seemed utterly impossible to say who
would win. On the one side were ranged weight and science and a shoe; on the
other, wings and astounding agility and utter unscrupulosity. After the first
round, I heard people in adjacent cabins waking up and murmuring unkind
things&mdash;not about the cockroach, but concerning me. Then I called &ldquo;Time,&rdquo; and
walked out to the centre of the room. The cockroach did not come. I looked
round and saw him sitting in my open port, twirling his moustache and gazing
out upon the sea. I said &ldquo;Time&rdquo; again, but he paid no attention; so I stole
upon him, with the stealth of a wild Indian, and smote him behind. This action
was unsportsmanlike, but conclusive. He shot out into the ocean, where
probably some not over-particular tropic fish attempted to digest him and
failed.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;smote him behind.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>As the &ldquo;Rhine&rdquo; approached Dominica, the Fourth Officer, according to his
pleasant custom, approached me, armed with facts. On this occasion, however, I
had taken measures to be before him. I had read up the island rather
carefully, and, knowing that Columbus was always a safe card, had acquired
some information on the subject of that great navigator also. So I waited with
quiet confidence for the Fourth Officer to start. He said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here we are at Dominica&mdash;an interesting and beautiful spot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;Christopher Columbus discovered the place in 1493.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Fourth Officer looked startled and uneasy, but I pushed on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The French and hurricanes between them have done much to wreck this island&#8217;s
chances. Matters, however, are more hopeful now. Dominica abounds in sulphur
springs, and vast sulphurous accumulations occur inland. Even the bed of the
River Roseau is not free from these volcanic outbursts. Formerly the place
produced very famous and high-class coffee, but this cultivation was ruined by
an insect pest. Now, you shall find that sugar-cane, cocoa, and limejuice are
the principal products. The<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 337]</span> manioc root, of which cassava bread is made, also
grows abundantly here, and basket work is rather an important industry too. In
the year 1881, there were still a hundred and seventy-three pure aboriginal
Caribs left in Dominica, but they have not been counted lately. I don&#8217;t fancy
they like it. The port of the isle is Roseau, named after the river. We shall
presently anchor off this town. I don&#8217;t know that there is anything more to
say.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/img338.png" width="500" height="450" alt="&quot;the fourth officer looked startled and uneasy.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;the fourth officer looked startled and uneasy.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Then I looked at the Fourth Officer inquiringly. He was evidently hurt. He
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&#8217;t fancy that there is anything more to say.&rdquo; Then he shook his head
rather reproachfully, and walked off to the other end of the ship. In fact, he
went as far away from me as he possibly could without getting into the sea. I
felt sorry, and followed him, and begged him to tell me about his younger
days, when he was an apprentice, and first sailed the ocean. This cheered him
up, and he recounted a mad freak off Cape Horn by night. It happened that
another sailing ship was following his vessel, so he and a friend began
hanging out signal lamps to her, and waving green and blue and yellow and
crimson lights over the stern of their ship. The approaching barque stood this
display for some time, and then, probably under the impression she was running
into a chemist&#8217;s shop, grew frightened, and changed her course, and was no
more seen. Our Fourth Officer, I should think rightly, regards this as one of
his happiest efforts.</p>

<p>The Doctor has already arranged a programme for Roseau. One Podbury dwells
there, and this Podbury brews the best rum punch in the West Indies. The
Doctor knows and esteems him. My brother is also familiar with the Bishop of
Dominica, and says that he is a genial, lovable Irishman of admirable parts,
and the best company in the world. It is agreed, therefore, that we first<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 338]</span>
call upon the Bishop, then see the town, and finally cheer our exhausted
systems with Podbury&#8217;s rum punch. Neither the Bishop nor Podbury has invited
us, or knows we are here at all; but that is a sort of detail which counts for
nothing in foreign parts.</p>

<p>Dominica is very beautiful, with the same beauty as many other islands already
mentioned. Great wooded hills rise, peak upon peak, to the clouds, and between
them lie deep gorges and fertile ravines. The margins of the sea are fringed
with palms; Roseau itself lies glimmering upon the shore, with white walls and
red and grey roofs. Inland, winding out under low cliffs behind the town,
flows forth the river over a rocky bed to the sea. This stream produces some
very noble scenery towards the interior, and is rather a large volume of water
for such a small island. As a result Dominica is extremely damp at seasons of
much rain, and grows, among other things, frogs of majestic size.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/img339.png" width="500" height="349" alt="&quot;the doctor was fussing about.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;the doctor was fussing about.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>By kind permission of the Captain, I was allowed to avail myself of the
mail-boat at all ports; and now, tumbling into this vessel, the Doctor and I
soon reached dry land.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us bolt straight off to the Cathedral,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;ten to one the Bishop&#8217;s
there; if not, we can go on to his house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roseau appeared to be rather a languishing little town. The stony streets were
all overgrown with grass; the place generally lacked any air of enterprise;
the negro children, who swarmed everywhere, were more than usually destitute
of attire.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the Bishop&#8217;s place of business, we found to our dismay that a
funeral was going on. The Cathedral doors were wide open, a crowd was gathered
within, and over a flower-laden bier stood the Bishop, singing away, and as
fully occupied as a man could be.</p>

<p>I noticed that the Doctor was fussing about, trying to catch his friend&#8217;s eye.
I therefore said:<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 339]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t; it isn&#8217;t decent. You can&#8217;t expect even a bishop to be genial and
effusive at a time like this. Consider the survivors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He sees me!&rdquo; whispered my brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sees you; yes, not being blind he couldn&#8217;t help it. Everybody in the
Cathedral sees you; and they very naturally resent the sight. Come away;
you&#8217;re making the Bishop nervous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It really was most annoying. There he stood, so close that we could almost
touch him, and yet separated from us by a gulf only to be bridged by the end
of his burial service.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/img340.png" width="500" height="371" alt="&quot;we met podbury.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;we met podbury.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>The Doctor became illogical and childish about it. When I had dragged him away
from these last sad rites, he gave it as his opinion that any other bishop
would have stopped, just for a moment at least, and been friendly and
enthusiastic, if only in an undertone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He may get thousands of opportunities to bury people, but he will never have
a chance of seeing you again,&rdquo; said my brother. Then he added, as an
afterthought, &ldquo;And very probably you will never get another opportunity of
talking to an Irish bishop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After that he sneered at the local medical practitioner, and said that likely
enough the deceased would not have died at all in proper hands.</p>

<p>Then a thought struck me, the horror of which reduced my brother to absolute
despair. I said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the Bishop is interring Podbury. In that case everybody you know on
this island will be busy, and we shan&#8217;t get any hospitality, or punch, or
anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just my luck if he is,&rdquo; answered the Doctor gloomily. He then kept absolute
silence for half-an-hour, during which time we walked to the Roseau River and
beheld many black laundresses<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 340]</span> out in mid-stream washing clothes. Turning from
this spectacle, he spoke again and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our present state of suspense is destroying me. I&#8217;ve a terrible presentiment
that they <em>were</em> burying Podbury. If so, we&#8217;re done all round. I&#8217;m going right
away to Podbury&#8217;s now. I shall see in a moment by the blinds if the worst has
happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We sought out Podbury&#8217;s desolate home, and the Doctor asked bitterly why
Providence should have snatched away one whose skill in the matter of rum
punch was a household word. I said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try and feel hopeful. We cannot yet be absolutely certain that he has gone.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 424px;">
<img src="images/img341.png" width="424" height="500" alt="&quot;magnificent!&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;magnificent!&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>And then we met Podbury in the Market Place. He was thoroughly alive, and
apparently in good health.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Doctor!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;back again. Glad to see you. How are the boys on
the &lsquo;Rhine?&rsquo; Who&#8217;s your friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was made known to Podbury, and explained how the sight of him had turned our
mourning into joy, and how I had come out from England as much to taste his
celebrated rum punch as anything else. He appeared gratified at this, and led
the way to his house.</p>

<p>We asked him who the Bishop was burying, and he did not even know. He said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A nigger, for certain. Can&#8217;t be anybody of much account or I should have
heard tell of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then we reached his home, and while he brewed cold punch, we talked to his
wife and daughters and some aunts that he had, on his father&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>The Treasure dropped in too. He knew Podbury well, and Podbury regarded him as
an authority on punch. The liquid was presently placed before us. Podbury
showed pleasure when I<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 341]</span> said what I thought about it; but he did not feel
quite contented until he had expert&#8217;s opinion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Magnificent!&rdquo; the Treasure presently declared; &ldquo;why it&#8217;s equal to the 1890
brew&mdash;you remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Podbury&#8217;s eye brightened at this allusion to one of his greatest past
triumphs. He tasted the punch himself, and admitted that it certainly seemed
&ldquo;about right.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 274px;">
<img src="images/img342.jpg" width="274" height="500" alt="&quot;the punch was good.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;the punch was good.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>With a desire to be entertaining, I volunteered a fact or two concerning punch
generally. I said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our word &lsquo;punch,&rsquo; as you are doubtless aware, is derived from the Hindustani
&lsquo;<em>panch</em>&rsquo; or Sanskrit &lsquo;<em>panchan</em>&rsquo;; which mean simply &lsquo;five.&rsquo; Punch is a
mixture of five ingredients, hence the name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everybody was rather impressed with this apposite remark, excepting Podbury.
He answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&#8217;s so. I&#8217;ve known it years and years. You bet what I don&#8217;t know
about punch isn&#8217;t worth knowing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This I took to be sheer conceit on the part of Podbury. His successes with
punch were making the man egotistical. I did not believe that he had heard of
these interesting points before, whatever he said to the contrary. At any
rate, they were quite new to his wife and daughters and aunts. So I turned my
attention to them, and told them several other things worth knowing. They
doubtless retailed my information to Podbury after we had departed. Still the
punch was good and cooling, and, with a heart that rises above trifles, I here
deliberately bless the man who brewed it. To be thus publicly blessed in print
ought to content even Podbury.</p>

<p>When we returned to the &ldquo;Rhine&rdquo; night had shaken out her starry skirts, and
land and sea were very dark. But great electric eyes glared down from either
side of the ship, facilitating the business of loading, and shining upon a
struggling crowd of lighters, and a yelling, swearing assembly of negroes.
Steam cranes groaned and shrieked and rattled; new passengers were coming
aboard, driven to madness with luggage; and sundry Dominica tradesmen bustled
about, selling curiosities. These people vended<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 342]</span> stuffed frogs, the skins of
humming-birds, Brazilian beetles, and gigantic Rhinoceros beetles also.</p>

<p>Five or six of them hemmed in the Doctor immediately he arrived, but, finding
that he had already laid in frogs and beetles, they turned upon me with grim
determination to do business, or perish in the attempt. My knowledge of the
&ldquo;Rhine&rdquo; enabled me to escape from all save one, but he was as familiar with
our vessel as I, and finally, penning me in a corner, he produced a frog as
big as a lap-dog, and declared that it was his almost suicidal intention to
practically give me the thing for half-a-dollar. I said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, John. I am perhaps as good a judge of a bull-frog as anybody living, and
I tell you without hesitation that your frog is worth ten shillings. Don&#8217;t
dream of parting from it for less.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;massa gib me ten shillin&#39; for him?&#39;&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>He grinned, and asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Massa gib me ten shillin&#8217; for him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again, no, John. I do not need this Goliath of a frog. I am merely valuing
the reptile for your future guidance. Let me see those beetles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He showed me a weird creature, which looked as if nature had begun an insect
and then changed her mind and finished it off like a crab. This thing, with
the ferocious claw-like nose and chin, was a female Rhinoceros beetle, so the
owner explained. The male beetle appeared to be a harmless, mild concern of
much smaller size, and with no warlike appendages whatever. I never saw any
insect of the sterner sex labour under such crushing disadvantages.
Personally, did I belong to this order of coleoptera, I should sing extremely
small, and remain a bachelor, and creep or fly about quietly after dark, and
not affect ladies&#8217; society much. Probably, most gentlemen Rhinoceros beetles
do so. It must always be Leap Year with these concerns. If the males had to
propose, the race would long since have become extinct.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 343]</span></p>

<p>I bought a beetle or two, and then my merchant, with strange pertinacity,
returned to the bull-frog. Not far distant stood our Model Man, working for
his life. So I said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see that gentleman there&mdash;the one ordering everybody about and making so
much noise? Take your frog to him, tell him it is a ten-shilling frog, and he
will probably buy it on the spot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But this frog vendor knew the Model Man from experience. He evidently had no
inclination to attempt any business with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dat gem&#8217;man no buy nuffing, sar. He berry sharp wid me &#8217;fore to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/img344.png" width="400" height="396" alt="&quot;a full-bodied gentleman.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;a full-bodied gentleman.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Indeed, the near presence of the Model Man discouraged my friend to such an
extent that he presently withdrew. I told his enemy afterwards, and the Model
Man said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Offer his beastly frogs to ME! If he had dared to, I should have pitched him
into the sea, stock and all. I did once, when he began bothering people to buy
things they had no wish for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;doubtless he alluded to that circumstance when he told me you
had been sharp with him before to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among the passengers who joined us at Dominica was an old friend, an ample,
full-bodied, admirable gentleman who travelled from England with us, and found
the ocean extremely monotonous and trying upon the voyage out. The same
trouble still dogged his footsteps. He came aboard quite wild and haggard, and
declared the universal and appalling lack of variety was telling upon his
health.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just think of it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;wherever you turn, nothing but negroes and
cocoanut palms, cocoanut palms and negroes. Every place is exactly like the
last; every palm tree exactly like every other; every negro identical with the
rest. I never saw such a monotonous set of islands in my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at their beauty,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have, until I&#8217;m out of all heart with it,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;A pinnacle or two,
with clouds round the top; a field of sugar-cane;<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 344]</span> hundreds of palms, hundreds
of blacks; mean houses and a paltry pier&mdash;that&#8217;s a West Indian island. I liked
the first; I tolerated the second; I even bore with the third; but the fourth
wearied me; the fifth harrowed me; the sixth sickened me; the seventh&mdash;that is
this one&mdash;has absolutely maddened me; and the eighth or ninth will probably
kill me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought not to have come here. Why did you?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/img345.png" width="500" height="370" alt="&quot;&#39;without firing off their wretched brass guns.&#39;&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;without firing off their wretched brass guns.&#39;&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;I took advice,&rdquo; he answered drearily. &ldquo;So-called friends assured me that what
I wanted was constant change of scene, with variety and novelty. They asserted
that these things were to be found in the West Indies, and I believed them.
Look at the climate, too; even that never changes. Look at the sky; English
people cannot stand this eternal surface of dead blue. They are not accustomed
to it, and it frets their optic nerves. In fact, the whole scheme of things
here sets the nervous system on edge from morning till night. There is a
cannon somewhere in this steamer, and it will fire in a moment; for no reason,
that I can see, except a nautical love of unnecessary noise. These ships
cannot come to a place or depart again without firing off their wretched brass
guns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went moaning away to his cabin, saying that he never knew one room from
another on board ship: they were all so exactly alike; and I proceeded to scan
further fresh arrivals.</p>

<p>One party consisted of a man and his wife. They had recently been turned out
of Venezuela, upon political grounds, and were now going up to St. Thomas, to
meet some friends there and arrange a Revolution. A very pretty little French
girl and her mother were also among the passengers. The Treasure knew them
well, and, when he heard they were coming, grew excited, and hurried away to
shave and change his clothes.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 345]</span></p>

<p>The Treasure&#8217;s Enchantress was certainly very beautiful, with a slight, trim
figure, great wealth of raven hair and flashing eyes. Moreover, she appeared
to like him, and told me that he always gave her mother the best cabin in the
ship.</p>

<p>There was a scene that night, after we started, between the Treasure and my
brother. It happened thus:</p>

<p>The Enchantress proved to be but an indifferent sailor, and sent for the
Doctor. He was just starting to comfort her when the Treasure arrived.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 331px;">
<img src="images/img346.png" width="331" height="500" alt="&quot;the treasure&#39;s enchantress.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;the treasure&#39;s enchantress.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Ill?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Ah, I knew she would be, poor girl; she always is. Tell her
to drink a pint of salt water. It&#8217;s the only thing. If that fails, tell her to
drink another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Doctor immediately showed anger. He said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks very much. It saves a medical man such a deal of bother when he has
got a chap like you always handy to do the prescriptions. Should you think two
pints of salt water would be enough? Hadn&#8217;t we better say a bucket of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may be nasty, but it&#8217;s none the less true that salt water is right,&rdquo;
answered our Treasure. &ldquo;Just because the thing is a simple, natural remedy,
you doctors turn up your noses at it. I know this case better than you do. The
girl has often sailed with us. Sea-water is what she wants to steady her. I
told her so before dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Doctor departed, and when he had gone, I asked the Treasure all about his
Enchantress. I said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it&#8217;s no business of mine, but I&#8217;m very interested in your welfare,
and might be useful. Where does she live?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has two addresses: one in Martinique and one in Paris. I know them both;
but I hardly think I should be justified in divulging them.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 346]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly you would not,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I should be the very last to suggest it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a little romance in a small way&mdash;I mean her life and her mother&#8217;s. The
father was a French Count, and died in a duel. That shows some French duels
are properly carried out. She is awfully rich, and not engaged. At least, she
doesn&#8217;t wear a ring. She likes tall men. Of course that&#8217;s nothing, but I
happen to be fond of small women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Merely a coincidence,&rdquo; I said, and he looked rather disappointed.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/img347.png" width="500" height="467" alt="&quot;&#39;she likes tall men.&#39;&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;she likes tall men.&#39;&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;We think curiously alike in a good many directions,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I taught
her to play deck quoits, and shot a few things for her with my gun. And she
gave me a photograph recently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of herself?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;not exactly that. She takes
pictures sometimes in a little pocket camera. She did one of an old negro
woman&mdash;ugly as sin; but it was not so much the subject as the thought of
giving it to me. It argued a friendly feeling&mdash;at any rate, a kindly feeling.
Don&#8217;t it strike you so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly it did. You&#8217;re a lucky man. How far is she going with us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To St. Thomas. She has a temporary address there, by-the-bye. I know that
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go in and win at St. Thomas. I believe it is a certainty for you; I do,
indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Treasure absolutely blushed. He was a very big man indeed, and produced
the largest extent of blush I ever saw.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 347]</span></p>

<p>Then my brother came back, looking extremely grave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is she?&rdquo; we asked simultaneously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very ill,&rdquo; he answered shortly. &ldquo;She was all right when we started, and never
better in her life; but, after dinner, she drank half a wineglass of salt
water, and the natural result has been disaster. I understand some fool urged
her to try this as a preventive of <em>mal-de-mer</em>. Her mother thinks it must
have been a coarse practical joke, and is going to speak to the Captain about
it. I wouldn&#8217;t be the man who prescribed that insane dose for a thousand
pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then an expression of abject dismay stole over the Treasure&#8217;s face as, despite
his great size, he appeared to shrivel and curl up into nothing.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 348]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Rev. Dr.<br />
Parker pays a<br />
visit.</div>

<p>My &ldquo;predicament&rdquo; was first &ldquo;awkward,&rdquo; then &ldquo;foolish.&rdquo; &ldquo;It was all along of&rdquo; a
woman. I may even say a &ldquo;woman in white.&rdquo; &ldquo;I was a pale young curate&rdquo; then,
but of a dissenting type. Twenty-two years of age. Very white in the face.
Dark brown hair, enough to fill a mattress. Very high collars, compared with
which Mr. Gladstone&#8217;s are mere suggestions. Huge white neckerchief. Black
cloth from top to toe. I was sent to visit an invalid lady somewhere in City
Road. A total stranger. Place: A shop. Room: At the tip-top of the house. The
last part of the staircase was exceedingly narrow and steep, the stairs
themselves little broader than a ladder. Tableau: A lady in bed, the only
occupant of the room; a young minister, nearly all head and shirt collar, the
rest of him a mere detail; the minister very shy and, as it were, &ldquo;struck all
of a heap&rdquo; by the novelty of his position. The young minister, nervously shy,
sat down, and the woman in white breathed a deep sigh. If my mother could have
spoken to me then, it would have been such a comfort. I felt as if up in the
clouds and the ladder had been stolen. There was not enough of me to break
into perspiration, or I should have broken. I know I should. On this point I
will brook no<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 349]</span> contradiction. There I sat. There were but two of us, and oh! I
felt so very high up, and so very far from the police. Even the street noises
seemed to be in another world, and that world next but one to this. The
silence was painful. At length the young mother, not so very, very young,
perhaps, turned her large brown eyes upon me in a fixed and devouring way, and
I can tell you what she said. Shall I? Can you bear it? I could not. She said,
with malignant slowness, &ldquo;I feel such a strong desire to kill somebody.&rdquo; I was
the only &ldquo;body&rdquo; in the room. How that young man got out of the chamber I could
never tell. He never revisited it. He was in the City Road as if by magic. Did
he pray with the woman? Not a word. Or she might have preyed upon him.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="sidenote">Burgin recalls<br />an incident.</div>

<p>I remember a couple of incidents, both of which gave me unpleasant dreams for
some time. The first was in connection with that noble animal which is so
useful to man&mdash;when it suits him. I was staying out at the Constantinople
fortifications with my friend, Colonel A&mdash;&mdash;, in a delightfully picturesque
little Turkish village called Baba Nakatch. We had no drains, no amusements,
no post&mdash;nothing but an occasional death from typhoid to vary the monotony.
When we tired of playing chess, we rode out and inspected fortifications,
<em>i.e.</em>, my friend the Colonel rode into a place with earthworks round it,
majestically acknowledged the salutes of the soldiers, and then rode out
again. It generally took four or five hours to go the rounds, and I humbly
remained outside each fort, only catching distant glimpses of the frowning
guns as I sat on an Arab steed at the entrance, and tried to look military.
One day, another Colonel, whose horse was pining for that exercise which his
somewhat indolent master felt disinclined to give him, suggested that I should
ride his grey charger and &ldquo;take the devil out of him.&rdquo; I couldn&#8217;t see any
devil in the horse when he was brought round. He was apparently calm and
sleepy, and tolerated me for about ten minutes. Then, without any warning, the
brute swerved round, and bolted back at a mad gallop in the direction of the
village. His mouth was like cast-iron, so I soon gave up pulling at it. The
gallop was exhilarating. Why trouble to stop? So I simply sat well back, and
awaited events. I hadn&#8217;t to wait very long. We cut round a corner, and dashed
up a muddy lane leading to the stables. Ten yards ahead of me, I suddenly
noticed a thick telegraph wire stretched across the road, a little<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 350]</span> higher
than a horse&#8217;s shoulders, which had evidently been diverted from its original
uses by an ingenious but unprejudiced Turkish soldiery for the purpose of
suspending their washed shirts. Rip! rip! Z&mdash;z&mdash;z&mdash;z! as I ducked to the
saddle-bow, and something scraped across my back with a sound as of rending
garments. When I was able to reflect, I found the horse standing almost asleep
in the yard, with my soldier-servant respectfully holding my stirrup in his
hand. &ldquo;Shall I sew up the back of the Effendi&#8217;s jacket?&rdquo; he placidly remarked;
and the incident terminated.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="sidenote">Also another.</div>

<p>On the second occasion, I was badly scared. I reached Montreal one hot summer
night before the English steamer started. She was timed to leave at three in
the morning, and all passengers had to be on board the night before. It was so
hot that I was nearly suffocated in the close harbour. When I went down to my
cabin I left the door open, put my purse and watch at the foot of the bed,
under the mattress, and tumbled off to sleep. There was no light in the cabin,
as the steamer was moored alongside the wharf. When I awoke, I lay quite still
for a moment, vaguely conscious of impending evil. I could hear someone
breathe in the darkness&mdash;stealthy steps&mdash;then a hand groping lightly about
feeling for my throat. It rested there for a moment. There was a momentary
tightening of the fingers. Should I keep still, or make an effort? I kept
still, trying to breathe naturally. The fingers left my throat, and fumbled
under the pillow as if searching for something, then gradually retreated, the
breathing of the man became less distinct, and I was alone. With one bound I
reached the door, bolted it, and sat down on the floor in a helpless and
chaotic condition. The next day a new steward was missing; so were several
other things.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="sidenote">F. W. Robinson<br />has a predicament.</div>

<p>Oh, yes, I have had my awkward predicament too&mdash;you, gentlemen, have not had
it all your own way. It happened in &ldquo;the dead of the night&rdquo; at a big hotel in
a Lancashire watering-place, and my first notice of the forthcoming event was
given to me by a loud hammering at the front door. &ldquo;Gentleman home late,
decidedly noisy, and probably drunk,&rdquo; I soliloquised, and was about to resume
my slumbers when someone ran along the corridor outside, his or her naked feet
sounding oddly enough as<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 351]</span> they pattered, at a great rate, past my door.
&ldquo;Somebody ill,&rdquo; was my next thought. &ldquo;Very ill,&rdquo; was thought number three, as
more feet&mdash;also in a hurry&mdash;went bounding by. &ldquo;Perhaps a lunatic at large,&rdquo;
was my fourth reflection, as various voices sounded in the distance, several
of them in a high falsetto. I got out of bed, opened my door, and looked down
the corridor towards the big wide staircase in the distance. There was smoke
coming along the passage, a smell of burnt wood, and then a woman&#8217;s voice
giving out a bloodcurdling shriek of &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; That was quite enough notice for
me. Two minutes afterwards I was downstairs in the hall of that sensational
establishment.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="sidenote">It necessitates<br />unconventional<br />attire.</div>

<p>I was not alone. I was in a mixed assembly of a hundred men, women, and
children, who very quickly became two hundred, presently three hundred, all
told; visitors, waiters, chambermaids, hotel officials, huddled together in
the most incongruous and comic costumes, and thirty per cent. of them with no
costumes at all, unless night-shirts and curl-papers count. I was decorous by
comparison. I <em>had</em> on a pair of trousers (buttoned up the wrong way,
certainly), a billycock hat, a surtout coat, a walking-stick, and no shoes or
socks. The hall, being paved with marble, struck exceedingly cold to bare
feet, and with a total disregard for other people&#8217;s property I took down an
ulster from a rack, and stood on it until a gentleman from upstairs, who was
singularly distraught, emptied a whole pail of water over the balusters under
the impression that we were flaring somewhere below there. The conflagration
was on the first floor above a shop, which had caught light to begin with, and
burned through to the hotel bedrooms. Here were plenty of smoke, plenty of
&ldquo;smother,&rdquo; and a few flames in the corner, but no one knew what might be the
end of the business, and we were all prepared to march on to the breezy Parade
should the fire gain too much sway over the premises.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="sidenote">But is not very<br />serious.</div>

<p>The characters in this little domestic scene I found highly amusing after my
first scare, as I have no doubt I was a very amusing spectacle to others. The
most agile of the company tore up and down stairs with utensils of all kinds,
full of water, from the kitchen; sometimes they fell up the stairs, or clashed
against each other, and an awful mess was the consequence. One lady was
brought solemnly down in a large clothes basket, fright having deprived<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 352]</span> her
of the use of her limbs; two men in night-shirts stood against the front door
with small portmanteaus under their arms, extremely anxious to be the first to
get out alive; one old gentleman, also scantily clad, harangued us from the
first landing in a feeble and bleating fashion. &ldquo;Has any-any-body se-ent for
the fiiire brigade?&rdquo; he asked every two or three minutes, always forgetting
that he had been answered in the affirmative. He was sure that the fire
brigade had escaped every one&#8217;s memory but his own, and presently&mdash;it <em>had</em>
seemed a long while&mdash;the firemen in their brass helmets arrived, and brought
their hose into the premises and lumbered upstairs with it, and the engines
began pumping and thumping in the street. A quarter-of-an-hour finished the
proceedings so far as one&#8217;s personal safety was concerned, and by twos,
threes, and fours we slunk away to our respective rooms considerably ashamed
now of our get-up, and thankful in our hearts that the worst was over.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="sidenote">Gribble&#8217;s predicaments have been very common-place.</div>

<p>Most of my predicaments have been very common-place predicaments, and the ways
in which I have got out of them very ordinary and obvious ways. Once, when I
was a child in petticoats, I wanted to walk through a tunnel at the same time
as an express train, but my nurse ran after me and pulled me back. Once,
before I had learnt to swim, I was caught by the tide between Broadstairs and
Ramsgate; but some sailors came and took me off in a boat. Once again, I, who
cannot claim to be physically robust, was challenged to single combat by a
truculent Belgian miner of six foot three, with whom I had refused to drink
pecquet; but a steam tram happened to pass opportunely, and I escaped in it.
Lastly, there was my Alpine brigand. He, with all his faults, was picturesque.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="sidenote">With one<br />exception.</div>

<p>I believe&mdash;and I shall be glad to be contradicted if I am mistaken&mdash;that I am
the only living man who has ever been &ldquo;stuck up&rdquo; by a brigand in the middle of
a glacier. I had no idea that the man was a brigand until, by behaving as
such, he gave himself away; otherwise, I have no doubt I should have risen to
the occasion and taken to my heels. As it was, he gave me, as the gods gave
Demodocus, &ldquo;both good and evil.&rdquo; That is to say, he deprived me of my money,
leaving me in exchange a new sensation, and something interesting to write
about. If I were to generalise about brigands,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 353]</span> I should do so thus: Brigands,
I should say, are of medium height, slightly but firmly built; they wear
mutton-chop whiskers, and are dressed in brown; they carry their
luggage&mdash;their shaving tackle, I suppose, and their pyjamas&mdash;in red and white
handkerchiefs slung behind their backs; their appearance is ferocious, and
they go about with guns. They spend most of their time sitting on the lateral
moraines, pretending to be chamois-hunters. When they see solitary strangers,
they come down on to the glacier and accost them without introduction, their
usual form of salutation being, <em>Donnez-moi tout l&#8217;argent que vous avez?</em> The
ideal way to treat a brigand is to arrest him, drag him to the nearest police
station, and give him into custody. A more practical plan is to humour him by
relieving his necessities, and afterwards to recoup yourself by holding him up
to contumely in the press. But you must not expect him to be caught. The
Department of Justice and Police will show great energy in sending you his
<em>dossier</em> in several languages, so that you may be able to give chapter and
verse when you denounce him in print. The Chief of the Department may even
invite you to drink an absinthe with him in the Sion Casino. But, as for
catching your brigand, that request is much too unreasonable to be seriously
entertained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Frank Mathew<br />tells the truth.</div>

<p>I can lay no claim to the honesty that has made the other members of this club
so eager to expose their most awkward and ludicrous adventures. Why should I
publish my least pleasant memories to strangers? That is a task I would leave
to my enemies. Besides, whenever I have come to grief, some other fellow has
been to blame. When I fell into Hampton Lock, before the eyes of a multitude,
it was because that ungainly lout Jones let the boat swing. Jones laughed
then, and many times after when he told the story; but why should I help him
to spread it? But that is neither here nor there. If I had been always as
lucky as the other members of this club, who seem to have remained dignified
in their misfortunes, then I might be less reticent. And if I were so
unscrupulous as to speak only of things less bitter to remember, then I might
tell how on a Bavarian railway I was once waked at midnight by an excited
official who&mdash;with an air as if life and death hung on my answers&mdash;plied me
with questions in spite of my explaining to him that I did not even know what
language he was talking, and who at last rushed away leaving me doubting
whether he was a mad-man or a nightmare; or how I lost my way among the hills
by<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 354]</span> Bologna&mdash;at a time when I knew no Italian&mdash;and wandered for hours along
dusty roads, cursing the ignorance of the natives; or how, dining at
Lugano&mdash;in the open air and under a vine-covered trellis&mdash;I ordered a cheap
wine, new to me, &ldquo;Ch&acirc;teau-neuf-du-Pape,&rdquo; and was delighted when it was brought
to me reverently cradled and in an immemorial bottle, and when it proved to be
a wine of wonderful merit, and how my blood turned cold when the waiter gave
me the bill, for he had mistaken my order, and I had been drinking
Ch&acirc;teau-something-or-other, a priceless vintage.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="sidenote">Alden is not<br />sure which.</div>

<p>I am not sure what was my most awkward predicament, for the choice lies
between a prayer-meeting and Folkestone. This may seem obscure, but it isn&#8217;t,
as you will presently see. My Folkestone experience was as follows:&mdash;The
baby&mdash;I decline to specify whose baby, for the law of England does not compel
any man to confess that he is a grandfather&mdash;had been ill for a week, and the
physician said that we must take her to the seashore instantly. In
half-an-hour we had caught a train for Folkestone, which the baby&#8217;s mother,
remembering her sensations when landing from the Boulogne boat after a rough
passage, felt sure was &ldquo;all that there is of the most seashore,&rdquo; as the French
idiom has it. It was just about to rain when we reached Folkestone, and,
putting the baby and her attendant slaves in a carriage, I told them to drive
at once to the private hotel, which we had selected, and I would follow with
the luggage. It took some time to pile a mountain of boxes and bundles on the
top of the carriage, but, finally, just as the rain began to pour, a
self-sacrificing friend who had remained to help got into the cab with me, and
we told the driver to go to number 33, such-a-street. It was at the furthest
extremity of the town, and when we reached there, after two or three attempts
on the part of the top-heavy cab to upset, I was greeted by the information
that no such person as the landlady of whom I was in search lived there. What
was worse, nobody had ever heard of her, and no cab containing a baby had
called at the house that day. Where then was the baby, and its mother, and my
wife, and its other slaves? Obviously, they were lost somewhere in the town of
Folkestone, and our two cabs might drive up and down for months without ever
once meeting one another. I looked at my companion, and he looked at me in
silence. No language could do justice to the occasion, and we both recognised
the fact. I told the cabman to go to all the hotels in the neighbourhood,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 355]</span> and
enquire for a missing baby. He explained that there were nothing but hotels
and boarding-houses in Folkestone, and that to visit them all would take the
greater part of our lives; still, he would try. So we went to at least a dozen
different places, and, although twice a sample of the resident babies was
brought out for our inspection, we did not find the one for which we were in
search. Then the driver, seeing our despair, said that perhaps he had better
drive to the pier, and we said that perhaps he had. I think he had a vague
idea that we were lunatics, and could possibly be lured on board the Boulogne
boat, and so got rid of. But he thought better of it before reaching the pier,
and suggested that if we went back to the station, perhaps the stationmaster
might help us. So we went back to the station, merely to be told by the
stationmaster that he knew nothing about the missing landlady or the missing
baby, and didn&#8217;t want to, either. Once more the driver suggested the pier, and
we told him to drive us anywhere. It was now after dark, and being wet and
hungry, as well as devoid of wives and babies, we were beginning to be
reckless. All at once, a joyful cry sounded from a passing cab. It was the
voice of my wife, who was patrolling Folkestone in the hope of meeting us. Our
nightmare was over, and in a few more minutes we were clasped in the arms of
the baby&mdash;or, at any rate, we would have been had she been old enough to learn
the use of her arms. To the unmarried man the experience may not seem quite so
dreadful as it did to me, but let a married man mislay a valuable baby, not to
speak of a wife and daughter, in a strange town on a stormy night, and he will
know how near he can come to having a nightmare without preliminary pork and
sleep.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And tells of a<br />prayer meeting.</div>

<p>Once, when I was an undergraduate, a prayer-meeting was held in somebody&#8217;s
room, which I attended. I do not recollect what was the occasion of the
holding of this meeting, but I do remember that it was a particularly solemn
one. There were about thirty of us in the room, and the meeting had been in
progress for about half-an-hour, when it suddenly occurred to me that were
someone to burst into a laugh, the astonished expression of the others would
be something worth seeing. Then I thought how painful would be the feelings of
the man who laughed, and how he would be covered with shame and remorse. All
at once an irresistible desire to laugh came upon me. There was nothing
whatever to laugh at, and the mere idea of laughing in such a<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 356]</span> place filled me
with horror, but still the desire&mdash;a purely nervous one, of course&mdash;to break
out in a peal of laughter grew stronger and stronger. I bit my lips, and tried
to think of the most solemn and depressing subjects, but that laugh could not
be conjured in any such way; presently I knew that I was smiling&mdash;a broad,
complacent, luxurious smile. Just then, a man sitting opposite to me saw my
smile, and a look of cold horror spread over his face. At this I laughed
aloud, in a choking, timorous way, but loudly enough to attract the attention
of every one in the room. The mischief was now done, and, in the estimation of
my comrades, I was disgraced for ever, as the man ought to be who insults
pious people at their prayers. Being ruined, I thought that there was no
longer any necessity for prolonging that terrible effort to suppress a laugh,
and so I leaned back in my chair and laughed loud, long, and, in fact,
uproariously. The meeting came to a sudden pause. The first expression on
every face was that of amazed horror, but my laugh was contagious, and
presently someone else joined in, and before order was restored the room rang
with the laughter of a dozen men. All this time I was in an agony of
self-reproach in spite of my laughter. I virtually broke up the meeting, and
it was not until the clergyman, who presided, had dismissed us, that I could
command myself sufficiently to try to explain to him the purely involuntary
nature of my laughter. He was kind enough and intelligent enough to understand
the matter, but the greater part of those who heard me believe to this day
that I was a bold blasphemer of a peculiarly brutal character. I could never
begin to tell what mental suffering the affair caused me, but I can safely say
that I was never more miserable than I was at the very moment when I was
laughing the most thorough and ecstatic laugh that ever came to me.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Zangwill refuseth<br />to be drawn, and<br />runneth amuck.</div>

<p>I never was in an awkward predicament. I have seen it stated that I once wrote
&ldquo;To be concluded in our next&rdquo; without having the slightest idea how to
extricate my characters from the mess I had got them into, but that is another
story. There is not a word of truth in it. An awkward predicament is as
unfamiliar to me as a crinoline; I have never been in one. It is absurd,
therefore, to ask me what is the <em>most</em> awkward predicament I have ever been
in; besides, it is always so invidious to select. I really must refuse to
pander to editorial flippancy, and to add myself to the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 357]</span> April fools who will
scribble seriously upon the subject. I think, if this sort of thing is to take
the place of our sensible symposia, it is time the Idlers&#8217; Club was abolished.
The intrusion of ladies has spoilt everything. Once we sat with our feet on
the mantelpiece smoking. (My own cigar was always given me by the artist.) Now
we never smoke&mdash;Angelina won&#8217;t permit it. Tea replaces the whiskey of yore,
and the horizon is bounded by thin bread and butter. We are expected to stick
to one predetermined subject&mdash;doubtless for fear we might wander off into the
improper&mdash;and we are almost encouraged to bring our sewing. No more we enjoy
those delightful excursions to everywhere&mdash;interrupting one another <em>apropos
des bottes</em>, and capping an appreciation of Wagner with an anecdote about a
mad turtle. Yet this is the only natural style of conversation. Who ever keeps
to the point in real life? It is bad enough in examinations for the examiners
to ask you about Henry II. when you are anxious to tell them about Elizabeth;
or to demand your ideas on the manufacture of hydrochloric acid when the
subject nearest your heart is the composition of ammonia. But conversation
will not bear such inquisitorial pinning down to a particular point. It
becomes a dead specimen butterfly instead of a living, fluttering creature. I
think someone ought to tell the editors that they are simply ruining the club.
I shudder to think what will become of it in five years&#8217; time, when nobody
will belong to it but ladies and parsons. I would resign at once if it were
not for sheer generosity. The generosity of the editors is, indeed, beyond all
cavil. But even their generosity has its limits. It is as certain as
quarter-day that if I do not fill my allotted space I shall not get paid. And
yet, in the absence of any experience of the requisite nature, it is quite
impossible for me to say one word on the subject I have been asked to talk
about. I don&#8217;t wish to tell a lie or to throw away money, but it looks as if I
must do one or the other. Really, it&#8217;s the most awkward predicament I was ever
in.</p>
